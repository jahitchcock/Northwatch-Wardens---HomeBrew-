# Welcome to Aevoria



> *A world awakening from forgotten ages, where ancient mysteries stir beneath the surface of everyday life.*

## The World of Aevoria



**Aevoria** is a rich fantasy world of diverse cultures, ancient histories, and emerging mysteries. From the cold frontier regions of the north to the sun-drenched lands of the south, from elven forests to dwarven mountain kingdoms, Aevoria is a world where heroes forge their own legends.



The name **Aevoria** carries different meanings to different peoples:



- The **Solaris Dominion** claims it means "the land blessed by dawn" — a poetic flourish from their earliest poets

- The **Nullwood Elves** call it the "Quiet Age," the era after the world's great noise faded

- The **Stonebound Dwarves** use their own name — *Tharundor*, "the Stone That Remembers"

- In **Vharoxis**, they say Aevoria is whatever it needs to be; a name is just another mask



Each culture has its own interpretation, its own history, its own truth. Together, they form the tapestry of this world.

## Editing in VS Code (Homebrewery Preview)



This repository is set up to write and preview D&D content in a Homebrewery-style layout directly in VS Code.



- **Extension**: *Homebrewery Markdown Preview* (`officerhalf.homebrewery-vscode`)

- **Formatting**: Use `\page` for page breaks, `{{note}}` for DM boxes, `{{descriptive}}` for read-aloud text

- **Snippets**: Most Homebrewery-style snippets are available with the `brew` prefix (example: `brewStatBlock`)



### Homebrewery Best Practices



📖 **[Homebrewery Best Practices Guide](./.github/HOMEBREWERY_BEST_PRACTICES.md)** — Comprehensive guide to formatting D&D content with Homebrewery



📝 **[Adventure Template](./.github/templates/adventure_template.md)** — Ready-to-use template for new adventures



✨ **[Before/After Examples](./.github/FORMATTING_EXAMPLES.md)** — See how Homebrewery formatting improves content



### Commands



- `homebrewery.toggle` — toggles `homebrewery.enabled`

- `homebrewery.brew` — prints/exports to HTML



### Recommended preview settings



For best results, the workspace includes the following settings in `.vscode/settings.json`:



- `markdown.preview.scrollEditorWithPreview`: `false`

- `markdown.preview.scrollPreviewWithEditor`: `false`

- `markdown.preview.markEditorSelection`: `false`



These prevent the preview pane from jumping and avoid selection-hover effects that can disrupt the Homebrewery-style layout.
