}}

## What Makes This Campaign Different

### The Guild Structure
You're not just adventurers who happened to meet in a tavern—you're **members of the Northwatch Wardens**, a frontier guild dedicated to protecting the settlements of Northreach. Your character has made a conscious choice to join this organization and uphold its code.

### Contract-Based Adventures
The Wardens operate on a **contract system**. Jobs appear on the Waystone Board, and you choose which missions to accept. This structure supports:
- **Flexible attendance** — Real life happens; the guild accommodates it
- **Character goals** — Pick contracts that align with your motivations
- **Team variety** — Different contracts bring different wardens together

### Frontier Setting
Northreach is a **low-magic, high-stakes environment**:
- Most folk live practical lives; magic is rare and respected
- The wilderness is dangerous, and communities depend on each other
- Your reputation matters—people remember what you do
- Winter is honest: it'll kill rich and poor alike

### Why This Matters
Your character needs:
- **A reason to join the guild** — Not just "for gold"
- **Skills that contribute** — Combat, exploration, or social expertise
- **Ties to the frontier** — Why stay in this dangerous place?
- **Room to grow** — The guild supports advancement and improvement

{{note
##### Multiclassing

Multiclassing is allowed but discuss it with your DM first. The frontier rewards focused competence—make sure your multiclass serves a clear character concept rather than just mechanical optimization.
}}

---

## Step Two: Determine Ability Scores

**PHB Reference:** Chapter 1, pages 12-13

Your ability scores define what you're naturally good at.

### Ability Score Methods

**Standard Array (Recommended)**
- Use these six scores: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**
- Assign them to abilities as you choose
- Simple and balanced for all characters

**Point Buy (Alternative)**
- Start with all scores at 8
- Spend 27 points to increase them
- Maximum starting score is 15 (before racial bonuses)
- See PHB page 13 for point costs

{{note
##### Rolling for Stats?

Rolled ability scores (4d6 drop lowest) are **not used** in this campaign. The Standard Array or Point Buy ensure balanced characters and prevent "super characters" or "weak characters" from luck.
}}

### Ability Scores in Northreach

#### Strength
**Guild Value:** High  
**Frontier Context:** Physical labor is constant—hauling gear, breaking down doors, surviving cold, and fighting when diplomacy fails.

**Recommended for:** Barbarians, Fighters, Paladins, some Rangers  
**Decent for:** Clerics, Druids (medium armor builds)  
**Skip if:** You're focused on finesse or magic

\column

#### Dexterity
**Guild Value:** Very High  
**Frontier Context:** Dodging attacks, sneaking past threats, surviving traps, and handling ranged combat. Also affects initiative and AC.

**Recommended for:** Everyone (at least 12-14)  
**Priority for:** Monks, Rangers, Rogues, light armor casters  
**Skip if:** You're wearing heavy armor

#### Constitution
**Guild Value:** Critical  
**Frontier Context:** Hit points keep you alive. The frontier is unforgiving—low HP characters die easily.

**Recommended for:** Everyone (at least 12-14)  
**Priority for:** Frontline fighters, any class with d8 or lower hit dice  
**Skip if:** You enjoy dying (don't skip this)

#### Intelligence
**Guild Value:** Moderate  
**Frontier Context:** Investigation, understanding lore, recalling information. Not everyone needs to be smart, but the guild needs some sharp minds.

**Recommended for:** Wizards (primary), Investigators, Artificers  
**Decent for:** Everyone (skills like History, Nature, Investigation are useful)  
**Skip if:** Someone else handles the thinking

#### Wisdom
**Guild Value:** Very High  
**Frontier Context:** Perception keeps you alive. Spotting ambushes, sensing danger, reading people, and understanding nature are all Wisdom-based.

**Recommended for:** Everyone (at least 12)  
**Priority for:** Clerics, Druids, Rangers, Monks  
**Skip if:** You're fine being surprised constantly

#### Charisma
**Guild Value:** Moderate to High  
**Frontier Context:** Diplomacy, persuasion, and intimidation solve problems without violence. Small communities remember how you treat them.

**Recommended for:** Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, Warlocks  
**Decent for:** Party face, anyone handling negotiations  
**Skip if:** Someone else does the talking

\page

### Sample Ability Score Arrays

Here are effective ability score distributions for common builds:

#### Frontline Melee (Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin)
- **Primary:** STR 15 (+2 racial) = 17
- **Secondary:** CON 14 (+1 racial) = 15
- **Tertiary:** DEX 13 or WIS 13
- **Dump Stats:** INT 8, CHA 10 (or CHA 12 if Paladin)

#### Finesse Melee (Monk, Rogue, DEX Fighter)
- **Primary:** DEX 15 (+2 racial) = 17
- **Secondary:** WIS 14 or CON 14
- **Tertiary:** CON 13 or WIS 13
- **Dump Stats:** STR 8, INT 10

#### Archer/Ranged (Ranger, Rogue, Fighter)
- **Primary:** DEX 15 (+2 racial) = 17
- **Secondary:** WIS 14 (Rangers) or CON 14
- **Tertiary:** CON 13 or INT 13

- **Primary:** CHA/DEX 15 (+2 racial) = 17
- **Secondary:** CON 14 or DEX 14
- **Tertiary:** WIS 13 (Perception!)
- **Dump Stats:** STR 8, INT 10

{{note
##### Dump Stats and Roleplay

Having an 8 in a stat doesn't mean you're incompetent—it means you're below average in that area. A Fighter with INT 8 isn't an idiot; they're just not scholarly. A Wizard with STR 8 isn't helpless; they're just not strong. Use low stats for character flavor, not as an excuse for absurd behavior.
}}

## Step Three: Choose Your Race

{{descriptive
**Rare Races in Northreach:** Aarakocra, Genasi, Goliaths, Tabaxi, Firbolgs, and similar races are **uncommon but not impossible**. If you want to play one, work with your DM to explain how your character ended up on this frontier.

3. **Frontier Integration** — How does your background explain why you're here?

{{note
##### Tasha's Cauldron Racial Rules

**Customizing Your Origin** (Tasha's, page 8) is allowed:
- Reassign racial ability score bonuses

This represents personal training and choices rather than "standard" racial traits. Discuss with your DM.

\column

#### Personality Traits
Choose 2-3 traits that define how you act:
- How do you approach problems?
- What quirks do you have?
- How do you interact with others?

{{note
##### Personality and Roleplay

}}

\page

### Physical Description

Describe what others see:

**Appearance:**
- Height and build (within racial norms)
- Hair, eyes, skin tone
- Notable features (scars, tattoos, etc.)
- Typical clothing style

**Age:**

{{descriptive
##### Sample Character Description

**Rogar Ironfoot, Male Mountain Dwarf Fighter**

Rogar stands 4'6" with the broad shoulders and thick build typical of mountain dwarves. His auburn beard is braided with steel rings, and his hands are calloused from years of smithing. A burn scar runs along his left forearm—a reminder of his first major mistake at the forge.

He's 67 years old, considered mid-life for a dwarf, and carries himself with the confidence of someone who's survived hard lessons. He speaks slowly and deliberately, choosing words as carefully as hammer strikes. When thinking, he unconsciously taps his fingers in patterns—testing imaginary metal for flaws.

His armor is practical, well-maintained, and engraved with geometric patterns. He carries himself like someone who knows exactly how much weight he can carry and refuses to take on more—physically or emotionally.
}}

## Step Six: Choose Equipment

**PHB Reference:** Class sections for starting equipment

You get equipment from three sources:
1. **Class starting equipment** (PHB, your class section)
2. **Background equipment** (PHB, your background)
3. **Warden's Kit** (provided by the guild—see next page)

### Starting Gold Alternative

Instead of taking class equipment packages, you can roll for starting gold and buy equipment:
- **PHB Reference:** Page 143, "Starting Wealth by Class"

**Optional Additions** (choose one):
- Climbing kit

- Snowshoes

{{note
##### Equipment Philosophy

The guild provides **basic survival gear**, not weapons or armor. Mara expects you to maintain your own combat equipment—"You want better gear? Earn it on contracts."

Wardens returning from successful contracts often upgrade their equipment with their share of payment or salvaged gear.

##### Equipment and Character Wealth

At 3rd level, you start with your equipment packages plus modest savings—**100-200 gp** worth of gear total. You're not wealthy, but you're competent professionals with the tools of your trade.

As you complete contracts, you'll earn payment and find better equipment. The frontier rewards capable wardens with better tools.
}}

### Starting Funds

Beyond your equipment, you start with:
- **Remaining gold** from your starting wealth (usually 10-25 gp)
- **First contract advance** (25 gp from the guild as a signing bonus)

**Total liquid funds:** Approximately **35-50 gp**

This is enough for:
- Extra supplies before your first mission
- Drinks at the Waystone Inn
- Small purchases in settlements
- Emergency needs

### Creating Connections

Strong campaigns emerge from character connections. Consider:

#### Connections to Other PCs

Work with other players to establish relationships:
- **Shared History:** Fought together before joining
- **Mentor/Student:** One taught the other a skill
- **Rivals:** Friendly competition or uneasy alliance
- **Family:** Siblings, cousins, or found family
- **Saved Each Other:** One saved the other's life
- **Complementary Skills:** You work well together professionally

{{note
##### Session Zero

During Session Zero, work with other players to establish at least **one connection** to another PC. Even a simple "we arrived at the guild the same day" creates roleplay opportunities.
}}

#### Connections to the Guild

Choose one relationship with the guild leadership:

**Marshal Brenna Thorne:**
- She recruited you personally
- You served under her in the military
- She reminds you of someone from your past
- You're trying to impress her
- She gave you a second chance

**Steward Mara Fenwick:**
- You owe her money (payment plan!)
- She helped you get proper equipment
- You appreciate her no-nonsense efficiency
- She's taught you about frontier logistics
- You're slightly intimidated by her

**Lorewarden Elric Vael:**
- He's helping you research something
- You share an interest in ancient ruins
- He's teaching you to document your findings
- You find his endless questions exhausting
- He reminds you why you became a [class]

#### Connections to Settlements

Choose one settlement you have history with:

**Welton (southwest, farming village):**
- You grew up here or have family here
- You helped defend against the wolves
- You trade with local farmers
- Someone here owes you a favor

\column

**Palebank Village (northeast coast):**
- You survived the frigid sickness outbreak
- You know the fishers and traders
- You're fascinated by the nearby ruins
- Someone here distrusts you

**Pinebrook (southeast):**
- You've done work here before
- You have business contacts here
- A friend or family member lives here
- You're investigating something nearby

**Waystone Inn (guild headquarters):**
- You've stayed here for weeks/months
- The staff knows your habits
- You feel genuinely at home
- This is the first stable home you've had

### Starting Reputation and Rank

All new wardens begin as **Unblooded** members:
- You've taken the oath and received your badge
- You're not yet proven in the field
- Other wardens are cautiously welcoming
- You need to complete contracts to advance

**After your first completed contract, you become a Proven Warden.**

{{descriptive
##### Your Warden's Badge

Your badge is a silver medallion stamped with the guild symbol—a watchtower with a beacon flame. On the back, your name and the date you joined are engraved.

The badge serves as identification, helps you requisition supplies, and marks you as someone who's sworn to protect Northreach. Losing your badge is serious—Mara will replace it, but she'll also make sure everyone knows you were careless.

Some wardens wear their badges openly. Others keep them hidden and produce them only when needed. Your choice reflects your relationship with the guild identity.

## Example Character Creation

Let's create a character together, step by step.

### Step One: The Concept

**Initial Idea:** "I want to play a tough warrior who protects people."

Let's develop this into a full character.

### Step Two: Choose Class

**Decision:** Fighter (Battle Master)  
**Reasoning:** Fighters are versatile, durable, and excellent protectors. Battle Master gives tactical options for protecting allies and controlling enemies.

### Step Three: Ability Scores

Using **Standard Array** (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8):

**Before Racial Bonuses:**
- **STR 15** (primary attack stat)
- **CON 14** (stay alive on the front line)
- **DEX 13** (decent AC in medium armor)
- **WIS 12** (perception matters)
- **INT 10** (average)
- **CHA 8** (not the talker)

### Step Four: Choose Race

**Decision:** Human (Variant)  
**Reasoning:** Versatility, and we get a feat at 1st level.

**Racial Bonuses:**
- +1 STR (now 16, +3 modifier)
- +1 CON (now 15, +2 modifier)
- Bonus skill: Perception
- Bonus feat: Sentinel (protect allies by punishing enemies who ignore me)

**Final Ability Scores:**
- STR 16 (+3), CON 15 (+2), DEX 13 (+1)
- WIS 12 (+1), INT 10 (+0), CHA 8 (-1)

### Step Five: Choose Background

**Decision:** Soldier  
**Reasoning:** Military training explains combat skills and gives us Athletics and Intimidation.

**Background Benefits:**
- Skills: Athletics, Intimidation
- Tool: Gaming set (dice)
- Feature: Military Rank

\column

### Step Six: Skills and Proficiencies

**From Fighter:**
- Choose 2 from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Survival

**Choices:** Athletics (background), Intimidation (background), Insight, Perception (racial bonus)

**From Soldier Background:**
- Gaming set (dice)
- Vehicles (land)

**Final Skill List:**
- Athletics +5
- Intimidation +1
- Insight +3
- Perception +3

### Step Seven: Equipment

**Fighter Starting Equipment:**
- Chain mail armor (AC 16)
- Shield (AC +2, total AC 18)
- Longsword (1d8+3 slashing)
- Two handaxes (1d6+3 slashing, thrown)
- Explorer's pack

**From Soldier Background:**
- Insignia of rank (kept as a memento)
- Trophy from fallen enemy (a notched blade)
- Set of bone dice
- Common clothes
- 10 gp

**From Warden's Kit:**
- Warden's badge
- Bedroll, blanket
- Mess kit, tinderbox, 10 torches
- 10 days rations
- Waterskin
- 50 ft rope
- Healer's kit (1 use)
- Signal whistle

**Starting Funds:** 10 gp (remaining) + 25 gp (guild signing bonus) = **35 gp**

\page

### Step Eight: Personality

**Name:** Torvin Brant

**Age:** 34 years old

**Physical Description:**
Torvin is a weathered human man standing 6'1" with a solid build. His brown hair is cropped military-short, and a jagged scar runs from his left temple to his jaw—a memento from a bandit ambush. His eyes are steel-gray and constantly scan his surroundings.

He wears his chain mail cleaned and oiled, his shield strapped to his back when traveling. The shield bears scratches and dents—marks of service. His longsword is practical and well-maintained.

**Personality Traits:**
- "I speak plainly and directly—no time for pretty words."
- "I'm always aware of exits and threats, even in safe places."

**Ideal:** 
- **Protection.** "Those who can't defend themselves deserve defenders."

**Bond:**
- "I failed to save my squad during an ambush. I won't fail again."

**Flaw:**
- "I have trouble trusting people I haven't fought beside."

**Alignment:** Lawful Good

### Step Nine: Backstory

**Background:**
Torvin Brant served as a sergeant in a southern regional guard for twelve years. He was competent, reliable, and respected. Three years ago, his squad was ambushed while escorting a caravan. Torvin survived; most of his squad didn't.

The ambush wasn't his fault—the intelligence was bad, and they were outnumbered three-to-one. But Torvin couldn't shake the guilt. He served out his contract, took his discharge pay, and left.

He wandered north, taking work as a caravan guard and bouncer, but nothing felt right. Then he heard about the Northwatch Wardens—a guild protecting frontier settlements. It sounded like a place where his skills could matter, where he could protect people who needed it.

Marshal Thorne interviewed him personally. She asked hard questions about the ambush, about his guilt, about why he wanted to join. At the end, she said: "The past doesn't change. But you can choose what you do with it. We can use someone who knows the cost of failure."

He took the oath that evening.

\column

### Step Ten: Guild Connections

**Motivation:** Debt of Honor / Prove Yourself
- Torvin needs to prove he can protect people again
- The guild gives him structured opportunities to do so

**Connection to Guild:**
- Marshal Thorne recruited him personally
- He respects her directness and leadership
- He's trying to earn her trust

**Connection to Settlement:**
- He's been living at Waystone Inn for three weeks
- The staff knows he drinks tea, not alcohol
- He's helped repair the palisade around the inn

**Connection to Other PCs:**
- (To be established in Session Zero)
- Possible: Met another PC on the road to Waystone
- Possible: Sparring partner with another martial character

### Step Eleven: Combat Role

**Combat Style:** Protection fighter
- **Primary Role:** Tank/Defender
- **Tactics:** Stand between enemies and allies
- **Sentinel Feat:** Punish enemies who attack allies
- **Battle Master Maneuvers** (at 3rd level):
  - Goading Attack (force enemies to attack me)
  - Riposte (counterattack)
  - Precision Attack (ensure hits land)

## Character Advancement and Milestones

Your character grows through play in the Northwatch Wardens campaign.

### Leveling System

**This campaign uses Milestone Leveling, not XP.**

You level up when the story calls for it:
- Complete a major contract or adventure
- Achieve significant character growth
- Reach narrative milestones

**Typical Pace:**
- Every 3-5 sessions, you'll gain a level
- Expect to reach 5th level by campaign's end (Season One)
- Future seasons continue from where you left off

{{note
##### Why Milestone Leveling?

Milestone leveling ensures everyone advances together and rewards storytelling over combat grinding. It also accommodates flexible attendance—missing a session doesn't put you behind.
}}

### Guild Rank Progression

Alongside character level, you gain rank in the guild:

| Rank | Requirements | Benefits |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Unblooded** | Join the guild | Access to board, basic supplies |
| **Proven** | Complete 1 contract | Respect, better contract access |
| **Seasoned** | Complete 5 contracts | Leadership opportunities |
| **Veteran** | Complete 10+ contracts | Guild influence, special contracts |
| **Elder** | Long service | Advisory role, train new wardens |

**Rank is separate from level.** A 3rd-level character who completes five contracts is Seasoned. A 5th-level character who's only done two contracts is Proven.

### What Changes as You Level

#### Combat Capabilities
- **More HP:** You survive longer
- **Better attack bonus:** You hit more often

- **Better AC:** Improved armor or magic items

\column

#### Out-of-Combat Growth

The first time you walk into the common room at Waystone Inn wearing your badge, other wardens nod in recognition. You're one of them now. Steward Mara Fenwick hands you a mug of hot cider and says, "Welcome to the guild. Don't make me regret issuing you that badge."

Marshal Thorne approaches, her steel-gray eyes appraising. "We've got work to do. You ready?"

This is where your story begins.
