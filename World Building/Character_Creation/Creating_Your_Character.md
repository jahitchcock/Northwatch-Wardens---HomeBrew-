# Creating Your Character

### *A guide for creating characters in the Northwatch Wardens campaign*
}}

{{descriptive
Welcome to the frontier. You've come to Northreach for your own reasons—seeking opportunity, fleeing trouble, or answering a call to adventure. The Northwatch Wardens accept capable individuals regardless of their past. What matters is what you can do now, and whether you're willing to stand with others when the cold winds blow.
}}

---

## What Makes This Campaign Different

### The Guild Structure
You're not just adventurers who met in a tavern—you're **members of the Northwatch Wardens**, a frontier guild dedicated to protecting Northreach settlements. Your character has made a conscious choice to join this organization and uphold its code.

### Contract-Based Adventures
The Wardens operate on a **contract system**. Jobs appear on the Waystone Board, and you choose which missions to accept. This structure supports:
- **Flexible attendance** — Real life happens; the guild accommodates it
- **Character goals** — Pick contracts that align with your motivations
- **Team variety** — Different contracts bring different Wardens together

### Frontier Setting
Northreach is a **low-magic, high-stakes environment**:
- Most folk live practical lives; magic is rare and respected
- The wilderness is dangerous, and communities depend on each other
- Your reputation matters—people remember what you do
- Winter is lethal: it doesn't discriminate

\column

### Campaign Themes
- **Investigation and exploration** over constant combat
- **Moral complexity** — not every problem has a clear solution
- **Community impact** — your choices affect settlements and people
- **Survival and resourcefulness** — the frontier is unforgiving

## Your Character Concept

Start with **who your character is**, not just what they can do mechanically.

### The Three Essential Questions

Answer these to ground your character in Northreach:

**1. Why did you come to the frontier?**
- Escaping something (debt, scandal, war, betrayal, family)
- Seeking fortune in a land of opportunity
- Following someone (friend, mentor, loved one, rumor)
- Driven by curiosity about the region's mysteries
- Answering a call for help from the Wardens
- Nowhere else to go

**2. What skills did you bring?**
- Combat training (guard, soldier, mercenary, pit fighter)
- Wilderness expertise (hunter, trapper, guide, ranger)
- Scholarly knowledge (researcher, mage, healer, sage)
- Social finesse (diplomat, merchant, performer, spy)
- Practical trades (smith, carpenter, herbalist, cook)

\column

**3. What keeps you with the Wardens?**
- The pay and regular work
- Protecting vulnerable communities
- Investigating the strange phenomena
- Brotherhood/sisterhood with other Wardens
- Redemption for past mistakes
- Nowhere better to go
- Personal quest (finding someone, uncovering truth)

{{note
##### Keep It Simple

You don't need a twenty-page backstory. One page is plenty. Focus on:
- Your character's personality and values
- Their reason for being here now
- What they hope to achieve
- What they fear or avoid

The best characters reveal themselves through play, not exposition.

## Classes in Northreach

All Player's Handbook classes work in this campaign, but some fit the frontier theme more naturally. Choose what excites you—competence matters more than optimization.

### Highly Recommended for the Frontier

**Barbarian** — The wild lands call to you. Primal fury and survival skills are invaluable in Northreach. *Recommended Paths: Totem Warrior, Ancestral Guardian*

**Cleric** — Healers and divine champions are desperately needed. The frontier tests faith but also needs it. *Recommended Domains: Life, Light, Tempest*

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CREATING YOUR CHARACTER}}

\page

### Well-Suited

**Bard** — Diplomats, chroniclers, and support specialists. Social skills solve many frontier problems. *Recommended Colleges: Lore, Valor*

**Paladin** — Oathbound warriors bringing justice to lawless lands. Your convictions will be tested. *Recommended Oaths: Devotion, Ancients, Redemption*

**Warlock** — Pact magic for power or knowledge. Your patron's interest in Northreach should be explained. *Recommended Patrons: Archfey, Celestial*

**Wizard** — Rare but valued. Arcane scholars investigating awakening magic find mysteries here. *Recommended Schools: Divination, Abjuration, War Magic*

### Less Common (But Viable)

**Artificer** — Researching Aeorian ruins or developing frontier survival tools. *Requires Tasha's Cauldron*

**Monk** — Unusual in Northreach. Perhaps you're from a distant monastery or seeking enlightenment. *Consider training origin*

**Sorcerer** — Wild magic and awakening power fit campaign themes. Your innate magic may connect to local phenomena. *Recommended Origins: Wild Magic, Draconic*


## Ancestries in Northreach

All standard D&D species exist in Aevoria. Here's what you'll find in Northreach and how they're perceived:

### Common

**Humans** — Most numerous; adaptable settlers from across Aevoria. They fill every role in frontier society.

**Dwarves** — Skilled in stonecraft and metallurgy. Some came north as prospectors or engineers seeking fortune. *Typical Classes: Fighter, Cleric, Artificer*

**Half-Elves** — Often serve as mediators between human and elven communities. Common and well-integrated. *Typical Classes: Bard, Ranger, Rogue*

**Halflings** — Practical and community-minded. Welton's shepherd culture is predominantly halfling. *Typical Classes: Rogue, Bard, Cleric*

### Uncommon

**Elves** — Most stay in the Nullwood Expanse. Those in Northreach are usually scouts, exiles, or scholars. Wood elves more common than high elves. *Typical Classes: Ranger, Wizard, Druid*

**Half-Orcs** — Accepted based on actions, not heritage. Many find the frontier's meritocracy welcoming. *Typical Classes: Barbarian, Fighter, Ranger*

**Tieflings** — Rare and sometimes viewed with suspicion, but respected once they prove themselves. *Typical Classes: Warlock, Sorcerer, Rogue*

\column

### Rare

**Dragonborn** — Extremely rare. Usually travelers or exiles from distant lands. Their presence draws attention.

**Gnomes** — A handful of tinkerers and scholars pursue arcane research or mechanical projects. *Typical Classes: Wizard, Artificer, Bard*

**Other Ancestries** — Tabaxi, Genasi, Aarakocra, etc. are exceptionally rare. Discuss with your DM and have a compelling reason for being on the frontier.

{{note
##### Frontier Practicality

In Northreach, your competence matters more than your ancestry. Prove you can handle the work, keep your word, and contribute to the community, and you'll be respected regardless of heritage.
}}

## Backgrounds and Previous Life

Your background represents your life before joining the Northwatch Wardens.

### Frontier-Appropriate Backgrounds

**Folk Hero** — You protected your community and gained a reputation. Now you seek to do more.

**Outlander** — You've spent your life in the wilderness. The frontier is home.

**Soldier** — Former military from southern kingdoms. You came north for a fresh start.

**Criminal** — Everyone deserves a second chance. Northreach doesn't judge your past if you contribute now.

**Sage** — You're researching strange phenomena in Northreach. The Aeorian ruins call to you.

**Guild Artisan** — Skilled craftspeople are always needed: smiths, carpenters, tanners, brewers.

**Hermit** — You sought isolation in the north. Now circumstances draw you back to civilization.

### Other Backgrounds

**Acolyte, Charlatan, Entertainer, Noble, Sailor, Urchin** — All work with appropriate backstory. A noble might be a disgraced heir seeking redemption; a sailor could be a shipwreck survivor; an urchin grew up in a settlement.

}}



## Skills and Capabilities

Given this campaign's investigative nature, these skills prove particularly valuable:

**High Priority:**

\column

- **Cartographer's Tools** — Mapping unknown territories

- **Elvish** — Old magic and Nullwood refugees
- **Giant** — Communicating with larger threats
- **Draconic** — Ancient texts and dragons
- **Goblin/Orc** — Frequent frontier threats
- **Primordial** — Understanding elemental phenomena

## Joining the Northwatch Wardens

Your character needs a reason to join or be interested in the guild. Consider these hooks:

### Motivations for Joining

**Idealists** — You believe in protecting the vulnerable and making the frontier safer. The work matters more than recognition.

**Pragmatists** — Steady employment, fair pay, mutual support. It's good work with decent people.

**Seekers** — Something strange is happening in Northreach. The Wardens investigate rather than ignore it.

**Survivors** — You need somewhere to belong. The guild accepts those who prove themselves, regardless of past.

**Exiles** — You can't return home. Northreach is far enough from wherever you're running.

**Redemption** — You're trying to make up for past mistakes by helping others.

**Justice** — Someone or something wronged you or someone you care about. The Wardens give you the means to act.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote CREATING YOUR CHARACTER}}

\page

### Your Current Status

**New Recruit** — You just arrived at Waystone Inn and are taking your first contracts.

**Returning Warden** — You've been gone for a while but are coming back to active duty.

**Vouched For** — Someone in the Wardens recommended you for membership.

**On Trial** — You're on a probationary contract to demonstrate your worthiness.

{{note
##### The Guild Code

All Wardens must uphold the Code:

1. **Protect the innocent** — Prioritize civilian safety
2. **Honor your contracts** — Complete jobs you accept
3. **Share vital information** — Keep fellow Wardens informed
4. **Respect the frontier** — Its people, land, and traditions
5. **Stand against corruption** — Mortal or magical
6. **Never abandon a companion** — Unless retreat is the only survival path

This Code provides in-character justification for party cohesion and moral boundaries.
}}


## Personality and Character

### Frontier Traits

The frontier shapes people in specific ways. Consider these common traits:

**Practical** — You focus on what works, not what's ideal.

**Direct** — Polite but straightforward. No time for excessive flattery.

**Resilient** — You don't give up easily. Survival requires persistence.

**Self-Reliant** — You handle your own problems when possible.

**Community-Minded** — Despite self-reliance, survival depends on cooperation.

**Adaptable** — Plans change. Weather, wildlife, and magic don't care about your schedule.

### Frontier Values

Understanding these helps you navigate Northreach society:

**Competence** — Can you do what you claim? Actions matter more than words.

**Keeping Your Word** — Contracts are sacred. Oath-breakers are marked as untrustworthy.

**Mutual Aid** — Help your neighbors during emergencies.

**Respect for the Land** — The wilderness is dangerous and should be treated as such.

These don't have to define your character, but they define how Northreach operates.

\column

### Personality Elements

Use your background's personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws as a starting point, but make them personal:

**Traits** — 2-3 defining characteristics. Are you optimistic or grimly realistic? Direct or diplomatic?

**Ideals** — What principle guides you? Justice, freedom, knowledge, power, community?

**Bonds** — What connects you to the world? A person, place, ideal, or organization?

**Flaws** — Everyone has weaknesses. A fear, vice, prejudice, secret, or personality trait that creates problems?

{{descriptive
*Remember: Your character doesn't need to be perfect. Flaws create interesting stories. A paladin who struggles with mercy, a rogue who's too trusting, a wizard who fears their own power—these tensions make for compelling play.*
}}

## Starting Equipment

### Equipment Package (Recommended)

Take your class's starting equipment package from the Player's Handbook plus the **Warden's Kit** (see page 2). This is simple and ensures you have everything needed.

### Alternative: Starting Gold

| Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Artificer | 5d4 × 10 gp |

### Essential Frontier Gear

If building from gold, prioritize:
- **Weapon(s)** — Your primary combat tools
- **Armor** — Best you can afford and wear
- **Backpack** — To carry everything
- **Bedroll** — Wilderness sleeping
- **Rations** (5+ days) — Food is life
- **Waterskin** — Hydration

### Spellcasting Components

**Arcane Focus or Component Pouch** — Required for most spellcasters. Don't forget this!

**Holy Symbol** — Clerics and paladins need this for spells.

### Don't Overthink It

You'll acquire more equipment through play. Start with essentials and build from there.

## Character Advancement

### After Character Creation

Once your character sheet is complete:

**Share with Your DM** — Let them review and provide feedback. They may have suggestions or plot hooks based on your backstory.

**Coordinate with Your Party** — Ensure you have balanced group composition. You don't need every role, but extreme overlap can be limiting.

**Read Campaign Materials** — Familiarize yourself with:
- **Chapter 3: Northreach: Your Starting Point**

{{note
**Welcome to Northreach.** *There's work to be done.*
