## Character Creation Overview

Creating a character for Northwatch Wardens follows the standard D&D 5e rules with some setting-specific guidance to help you fit into the frontier world of Northreach.

### Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Choose your ancestry/species
- [ ] Choose your class
- [ ] Determine ability scores
- [ ] Select a background
- [ ] Choose starting equipment
- [ ] Develop your character's connection to Northreach
- [ ] Consider your relationship with the Northwatch Wardens

---

## Ability Scores

Choose one of the following methods for determining your character's ability scores:

### Standard Array
Use these six numbers: **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8**

Assign them to your six abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) in any order, then apply your species modifiers.

### Point Buy
Start with all abilities at 8. You have 27 points to distribute:

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| 8 | 0 | 12 | 4 |
| 9 | 1 | 13 | 5 |
| 10 | 2 | 14 | 7 |
| 11 | 3 | 15 | 9 |

### Rolling (Optional)
With your DM's permission, roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, and sum the remaining three. Do this six times and assign the results to your abilities.

{{note
##### Recommended for Northreach
**Standard Array** or **Point Buy** are recommended for the Northwatch Wardens campaign to ensure balanced characters who can contribute meaningfully to the group.

## Ancestries in Northreach

All standard D&D ancestries (species) exist in Aevoria, but some are more common in Northreach than others.

### Common Ancestries

#### Humans
The most numerous people in Northreach. Settlers, traders, loggers, and farmers who came north seeking opportunity or escape.

**Typical Roles:** Any. Humans fill every niche in frontier society.

#### Dwarves
While most dwarves live in the **Stonebound Depths** to the south, some travel north as prospectors, engineers, or adventurers. Their stone-working and metalcraft are highly valued.

**Typical Roles:** Clerics, Fighters, Artificers, craftspeople

#### Half-Elves
Common throughout Northreach, often serving as mediators between human and elven communities.

**Typical Roles:** Bards, Rangers, Rogues, diplomats

### Uncommon Ancestries

#### Halflings
Present but not numerous, usually as traders, innkeepers, or traveling merchants. Known for bringing cheer to the cold frontier.

**Typical Roles:** Rogues, Bards, Clerics

#### Elves
Most elves stay in the **Nullwood Expanse**, their ancient forest kingdom. Those who come to Northreach are usually scouts, exiles, or scholars investigating the awakening magic.

**Typical Roles:** Rangers, Wizards, Druids

**Note:** Wood elves are more common than high elves in Northreach.

#### Half-Orcs
Accepted in Northreach based on their actions, not their heritage. Many find the frontier's meritocracy more welcoming than southern prejudices.

**Typical Roles:** Barbarians, Fighters, Rangers

#### Tieflings
Rare and sometimes viewed with suspicion by superstitious settlers, but respected if they prove themselves capable.

**Typical Roles:** Warlocks, Sorcerers, Rogues

\column

### Rare Ancestries

#### Dragonborn
Extremely rare in Northreach. Usually travelers or exiles from distant lands. Their presence draws attention.

#### Gnomes
A handful of gnome tinkerers and scholars can be found in Northreach, usually pursuing arcane research or mechanical projects.

**Typical Roles:** Wizards, Artificers, Bards

### Other Ancestries

If you want to play a more exotic ancestry (Tabaxi, Genasi, Aarakocra, etc.), discuss with your DM. These are exceptionally rare in Northreach, and you should have a compelling reason for being on the frontier.

{{note
##### Frontier Practicality
In Northreach, your competence matters more than your ancestry. Prove you can handle the work, keep your word, and contribute to the community, and you'll be respected regardless of your heritage.
}}

\page

## Classes for the Frontier

All D&D 5e classes work in the Northwatch Wardens campaign, but some fit the frontier theme better than others.

### Highly Recommended

**Barbarian** — The wild lands beyond civilization call to you. Your primal fury and survival skills make you invaluable.

**Fighter** — Every frontier needs capable warriors. Whether you're a former soldier, a mercenary, or a self-taught defender, your martial skills are essential.

**Ranger** — Scouts, trackers, and wilderness guides are the lifeblood of Northreach. You know the land and its dangers.

**Rogue** — Sneaking, scouting, and solving problems with cunning are as important as brute force. Trappers, scouts, and former criminals find purpose here.

### Well-Suited

**Cleric** — Healers and divine champions are always welcome. The frontier tests faith, but also needs it.

**Druid** — Those who understand nature's balance and can speak to the wild are respected, if sometimes feared.

**Paladin** — Oathbound warriors bringing justice to lawless lands. Your convictions will be tested.

**Wizard** — Rare but valued. Arcane scholars investigating the awakening magic find Northreach full of mysteries.

### Possible with Adjustment

**Bard** — Entertainers are rare on the frontier, but chroniclers, storytellers, and diplomats have their place.

**Monk** — Unusual in Northreach. Perhaps you're from a distant monastery or seeking enlightenment in the wilderness.

**Sorcerer** — Wild magic and awakening power fit the campaign's themes. Your innate magic may be connected to the region's mysteries.

**Warlock** — Pacts made for power or knowledge. Your patron's interest in Northreach should be explained.

**Artificer** — Rare but interesting. Perhaps you're researching Aeorian ruins or developing tools for frontier survival.

\column

{{note
##### Multiclassing
Multiclassing is allowed with DM approval. The frontier rewards versatility, and many Wardens develop diverse skills over time.

Remember that multiclassing requires meeting ability score prerequisites (13 or higher in specific abilities for each class). See the Player's Handbook for full multiclassing rules.

## Starting Level

Most Northwatch Wardens campaigns begin at **level 1** or **level 2**, depending on your DM's preference.

Starting at level 1 emphasizes the dangerous nature of the frontier and gives characters room to grow. Starting at level 2 provides a small buffer of survivability and lets you explore your class features earlier.

Discuss with your DM which approach fits your group's playstyle.

\page

## Backgrounds

Your background represents your life before joining the Northwatch Wardens. Choose one that fits your character concept and provides interesting roleplay opportunities.

### Frontier-Appropriate Backgrounds

**Folk Hero** — You protected your community from danger and gained a reputation. Now you seek to do more.

**Outlander** — You've spent your life in the wilderness. The frontier is home to you.

**Soldier** — Former military experience from one of the southern kingdoms. You came north for a fresh start.

**Criminal** — Everyone deserves a second chance. Northreach doesn't judge your past if you contribute to the present.

**Sage** — You're researching the strange phenomena in Northreach. The Aeorian ruins call to you.

**Guild Artisan** — Skilled craftspeople are always needed: smiths, carpenters, tanners, brewers.

**Hermit** — You sought isolation in the north. Now circumstances draw you back to civilization.

### Other Backgrounds

**Acolyte, Charlatan, Entertainer, Noble, Sailor, Urchin** — All work with appropriate backstory adjustments. A noble might be a disgraced heir seeking redemption; a sailor could be a shipwreck survivor; an urchin grew up in one of the larger settlements.

### Custom Backgrounds

Work with your DM to create a custom background if none of the standard options fit. Follow the standard structure:

- 2 skill proficiencies
- 2 tool proficiencies or languages
- Equipment package
- Feature

\column

{{note
##### Northreach Connection
Whatever your background, consider how you ended up in Northreach. Did you come seeking opportunity? Fleeing something? Born here? Each choice adds depth to your character and gives the DM hooks for personal storylines.
}}

## Starting Equipment

You can choose your starting equipment in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Class Equipment Package
Take the equipment listed in your class description. This is simple and ensures you have everything you need.

### Option 2: Starting Gold
Roll for starting gold based on your class and purchase equipment:

| Class | Starting Gold |
|-------|---------------|
| Barbarian, Druid | 2d4 × 10 gp |
| Sorcerer | 3d4 × 10 gp |
| Rogue, Warlock, Wizard | 4d4 × 10 gp |
| Monk | 5d4 gp |
| Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Artificer | 5d4 × 10 gp |

### Recommended Frontier Gear

Beyond your class equipment, consider these items:

- **Warm clothing** (included in most starting equipment)
- **Bedroll and blanket** (essential for survival)
- **Tinderbox** (fire is life in the cold)
- **50 feet of hempen rope** (countless uses)
- **Rations** (at least 5 days' worth)
- **Waterskin** (stay hydrated)
- **Backpack** (to carry everything)

## Connecting to the Northwatch Wardens

Your character should have a reason to join or be interested in the Northwatch Wardens. Consider these hooks:

### Motivations for Joining

**Protection** — You want to keep the frontier safe from threats, whether for idealistic or personal reasons.

**Coin** — The Wardens pay fairly for contract work, and you need the money.

**Redemption** — You're trying to make up for past mistakes by helping others.

**Investigation** — You're researching the strange phenomena in Northreach and need access to information and sites.

**Belonging** — You're looking for community and purpose. The Wardens offer both.

**Justice** — Someone or something wronged you or someone you care about. The Wardens give you the means to act.

**Curiosity** — The frontier is full of mysteries, and you can't resist exploring them.

**Duty** — You believe in the Wardens' mission and feel called to serve.

### Your Current Status

**New Recruit** — You just arrived at Waystone Inn and are taking your first contracts.

**Returning Warden** — You've been gone for a while but are coming back to active duty.

**Vouched For** — Someone in the Wardens recommended you for membership.

**Proving Ground** — You're on a trial contract to demonstrate your worthiness.

{{note
##### The First Contract
All Wardens must complete at least one sanctioned contract to achieve full membership. Your first adventure might be that contract, or you might have already completed it before the campaign begins.
}}

## Character Personality

Use the standard D&D personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws from your background as a starting point, but consider how the frontier shapes people:

### Frontier Traits

**Practical** — You focus on what works, not what's ideal.

**Direct** — Polite but straightforward. The frontier has no time for excessive flattery.

**Resilient** — You don't give up easily. Survival requires persistence.

**Self-Reliant** — You handle your own problems when possible.

**Community-Minded** — Despite self-reliance, you know survival depends on cooperation.

**Adaptable** — Plans change. Weather, wildlife, and magic don't care about your schedule.

### Frontier Values

**Competence** — Can you do what you claim? Actions matter more than words.

**Keeping Your Word** — Contracts are sacred. Breaking an oath marks you as untrustworthy.

**Mutual Aid** — Help your neighbors during emergencies.

**Respect for the Land** — The wilderness is dangerous and should be treated as such.

These values don't have to define your character, but understanding them helps you navigate Northreach society.
