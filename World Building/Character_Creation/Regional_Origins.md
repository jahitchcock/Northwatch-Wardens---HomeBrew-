# Regional Origins Guide
## Where You Come From Shapes Who You Are

{{descriptive
##### The Ten Regions of Aevoria

From the frozen wastes of the Far North to the sun-drenched plazas of Solaris, Aevoria spans a vast and diverse world. Each region shapes its people in distinctive ways—through climate, culture, history, and the values passed down through generations.

Your character's origin isn't just flavor text. It's the foundation of who they are, how they see the world, and why they've traveled to the frontier. Whether you're a Solarian bard seeking truth beyond the factions, a Stonebound geomancer studying frontier anomalies, or a Northreach native fighting for your home, your regional origin provides rich roleplay opportunities and meaningful connections to the wider world.

# The Ten Regions

## 1. Northreach — The Frozen Frontier

{{descriptive
Where winter bites and wolves prowl, where communities cling to survival through mutual aid and grim determination. This is the frontier—hard, honest, and unforgiving.
}}

### Overview

Northreach is a cold, sparsely settled frontier region where survival depends on self-reliance, practical competence, and community cooperation. Most inhabitants know only local concerns—wolves, bandits, missing hunters, and the ever-present threat of winter. This is the starting region for the campaign and home to the Northwatch Wardens.

**Climate:** Cold temperate to subarctic  
**Population:** Scattered villages, isolated farmsteads  
**Government:** Local councils, guild influence  
**Economy:** Subsistence farming, trapping, logging

### Common Backgrounds

**Folk Hero**  
You defended your village from wolves, bandits, or worse. The frontier breeds heroes out of necessity—those who stand when others can't.

**Outlander**  
The most natural choice for Northreach natives. You know the woods, the weather, and the dangers. You were born to this life.

**Soldier**  
Perhaps you served with a militia defending villages, or you're a veteran who sought peace on the frontier (and found new conflicts instead).

**Hermit**  
The frontier has plenty of isolated places for those seeking solitude. But even hermits eventually need to return to civilization—or defend it.

### Cultural Traits

- **Practical over proper:** If it works, it's good enough. Results matter more than tradition
- **Earned respect:** Your reputation is built by actions, not words or lineage
- **Mutual aid:** Communities survive by helping each other; selfishness is remembered
- **Wary of strangers:** Trust must be earned, but once given, it's genuine
- **Direct communication:** Frontier folk say what they mean; flowery speech is seen as suspicious
- **Respect for winter:** The cold is honest—it'll kill rich and poor alike

**Others See You As:**

}}

### Overview

Solaris is a vibrant metropolis known as the beating heart of music, storytelling, and bardic tradition. The city thrives on creativity, performance, and mythmaking—its plazas echo with tales and its streets feel like they're always mid-song.

**Government:** Factional (Harmonists, Veilbound, Chorus)

}}

Strange relics wash ashore, glowing currents appear without warning, and sea creatures behave unnaturally. Most believe it was a coastal empire swallowed by cataclysm; others claim it was always a realm of the deep. Either way, the Dominion is awakening—and not everyone who studies it remains unchanged.

**Climate:** Coastal and maritime  
**Population:** Coastal settlements ~3,000  
**Government:** Loose harbor councils, diving guilds  
**Economy:** Salvage, deep-diving, relic trade, fishing

### Common Backgrounds

**Sailor (Deep Diver variant)**  
You're trained in the dangerous art of deep-water salvage, recovering relics from the drowned ruins below.

**Sage (Marine Scholar)**  
You study the Dominion's artifacts, architecture, and anomalies, trying to understand what it was and why it calls.

**Hermit**  
You lived in isolation near the water, drawn to the whispers from below. Some say you spent too long listening.

**Haunted One (CoS variant)**  
You dove too deep, saw too much, or brought back something that won't let you go. The Dominion marked you.

## 10. The Far North — Where the World Ends

{{descriptive
Where blizzards rage without end, where ice stretches to the horizon, and where ruins emerge from eternal frost. The Far North is where civilization stops and something older begins.
}}

### Overview

The Far North is a frozen wasteland beyond Palebank Village, one of the most inhospitable regions in the known world. It's a place where survival is measured in hours without proper preparation, where nomadic groups eke out existence on the edges, and where ancient ruins emerge from the ice during brief thaws. Few travel there by choice. Fewer return unchanged.

**Climate:** Subarctic to arctic; perpetual winter  
**Population:** ~800 (nomadic and isolated)  
**Government:** Clan elders, survival hierarchy  
**Economy:** Hunting, ice fishing, limited scavenging

### Common Backgrounds

**Outlander**  
You're from one of the nomadic reindeer-herding or ice-fisher clans that follow the herds and seasons across the frozen waste.

**Hermit**  
You sought ultimate isolation in the world's harshest environment. Perhaps you found enlightenment—or just frostbite and madness.

**Folk Hero**  
You saved your clan from a blizzard, discovered a safe route, or defended against ice-touched predators. Your people remember.

**Soldier (Survivor variant)**  
You served in a failed expedition, refugee group, or research mission. You survived when others didn't.

\column

### Cultural Traits

- **Survival pragmatism:** If it doesn't help you live, it doesn't matter
- **Resource sharing:** Hoarding food in winter is murder
- **Respect for cold:** The ice is honest—it'll kill without malice
- **Oral tradition:** Stories are survival guides passed through generations
- **Minimal possessions:** Own only what you can carry when moving
- **Silent endurance:** Complaints waste breath and energy

{{note
##### If You're From the Far North...

**You Know:**
- How to predict deadly storms hours in advance
- That warmth is life; never waste fuel
- The ruins in the ice are dangerous for reasons beyond cold
- How to survive on minimal food and water
- That some sounds in the wind aren't wind

**Others See You As:**
- Taciturn and grim
- Incredibly tough
- Uncomfortable in "warm" weather (above freezing)
- Wasteful-averse to an extreme degree
- Someone who's seen things they won't discuss

**Why Travel to Northreach:**
- Your clan was lost to the ice
- Following game herds south
- Fleeing something emerging from the ruins
- Seeking "warmth" (even Northreach seems tropical)
- Guiding an expedition that never returned
- Warning of what's waking in the frozen north
}}

### Sample Character Concepts

**Eira Frostborn, Human Barbarian (Path of the Totem Warrior - Bear)**  
Last survivor of a clan lost to an unexpected deep freeze. Came south with their story and determination to ensure others remember. Rage is grief given voice.

**Njal Icecaller, Goliath Ranger (Monster Slayer)**  
Former expedition guide who encountered something in the Far North ruins that shouldn't exist. Hunts creatures touched by ancient cold. Doesn't talk about what he saw.

\page

**Frost, Kalashtar Monk (Way of the Long Death)**  
Hermit who meditated in ice caves until something spoke back. Emerged with uncanny cold resistance and fragments of memory that aren't his own. Seeking answers.

### Character Tie-In Questions

1. **What did the ice take from you?**
2. **How do you cope with the relative "heat" of Northreach?**
3. **What's the closest you came to dying in the Far North?**
4. **What did you see in the ruins that made you leave?**
5. **Do you ever want to return—or would death be preferable?**

## Roleplaying Regional Tensions

### Constructive Friction

**In Character:**
- "In Solaris, we'd spend a week planning. Here, we just... go?"
- "Your 'quick decision' carves scars that echo for generations."
- "You talk too much and say too little."
- "Where I'm from, silence means agreement. Here it seems to mean... confusion?"

**Challenge Assumptions:**
- Debate approach to problems based on cultural values
- Misunderstand each other's communication styles
- Question why someone values what they do
- Share stories showing different perspectives

**Find Common Ground:**
- Respect competence regardless of origin
- Adapt methods when others' work better
- Learn from different approaches
- Build team understanding through shared hardship

### Avoiding Problems

**Don't:**
- Use regional tension as excuse for PvP
- Make it about player conflict vs character difference
- Stereotype or reduce characters to regional tropes
- Ignore when tension stops being fun

**Do:**
- Treat tension as opportunity for character growth
- Show your character learning from others
- Let cultural friction create memorable moments
- Evolve your character's views through experience

{{note
##### DM Guidance

Regional tensions should enhance roleplay, not hinder it. If friction between characters stops being fun or constructive, address it out-of-game. The goal is interesting character dynamics, not party splits.

# Creating Your Regional Background

## Adapting Standard Backgrounds

Every D&D 5e background can be adapted to reflect regional origin. The mechanical benefits (skills, tools, languages, equipment) remain the same, but the narrative and feature flavors change.

### Regional Background Features

Many backgrounds include a **feature** (like Sailor's "Ship's Passage" or Soldier's "Military Rank"). Here are regional variants you can discuss with your DM:

#### Northreach Variants

**Frontier Network (Folk Hero/Outlander)**  
Northreach communities remember those who help them. You can find shelter, information, and basic aid from frontier settlements. People recognize you as someone who understands their struggles.

**Warden Reputation (Soldier/Guard)**  
If you've done contract work successfully, settlements in Northreach know your name. You gain advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with frontier communities who've heard of the Wardens' work.

**Winter Survivor (Outlander)**  
You know how to find shelter, preserve food, and survive conditions that would kill softer folk. Other survivors recognize this competence and respect it.

#### Solaris Variants

**Cultural Currency (Entertainer/Noble)**  
You know Solaris' current stories, songs, and social dynamics. In any major city, you can leverage this knowledge to gain audiences, information, or temporary prestige.

**Faction Contact (Sage/Acolyte)**  
You maintain connection to a Solarian faction (Harmonist, Veilbound, or Chorus). Once per city, you can contact them for information, resources, or temporary sanctuary—though favors may be expected in return.

**Performance Perfection (Entertainer)**  
Trained in Solaris' legendary venues, your performances are technically flawless. You gain advantage on Performance checks in professional settings and can command higher fees.

#### Nullwood Variants

**Memory Keeper (Sage/Acolyte)**  
You're trained in Nullwood memory techniques. You can perfectly recall information you've specifically memorized, and other Nullwood elves recognize you as educated.

**Silent Movement (Outlander/Hermit)**  
Nullwood training teaches supernatural quiet. You have advantage on Stealth checks in natural environments and can move through wilderness leaving minimal trace.

\column

**Emotional Discipline (Any)**  
Nullwood emotional training grants advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. Others see you as unusually calm under pressure.

#### Stonebound Variants

**Craftmaster's Mark (Guild Artisan)**  
You bear a maker's mark from the Stonebound Depths. Other crafters recognize quality work, and dwarven communities offer professional courtesy and discounted services.

**Stone Sense (Outlander/Soldier)**  
Underground experience grants you advantage on Investigation checks related to stonework, architecture, and underground navigation. You can detect unstable structures by touch.

**Resonance Training (Acolyte/Sage)**  
You can sense subtle vibrations in earth and metal. This grants advantage on Perception checks to detect tremors, underground movement, or hidden mechanisms.

#### Vharoxis Variants

**Black Market Access (Criminal/Charlatan)**  
You know how to find and navigate underground markets. In any city, you can locate fences, forgers, and smugglers within a day.

**Mask Culture (Any)**  
You're trained in reading people despite disguises. You have advantage on Insight checks to determine if someone is hiding their identity or true intentions.

**Syndicate Debt (Criminal)**  
A Vharoxis syndicate owes you a favor—one. You can call it in for significant aid, but afterwards the debt is cleared (and you'd better not owe them anything).

#### Shattered Coast Variants

**Storm Sense (Sailor/Outlander)**  
Coastal training lets you predict weather with uncanny accuracy. You have advantage on Survival checks related to weather prediction and can sense major storms hours in advance.

**Salvager's Eye (Criminal/Sailor)**  
You can assess wreckage, ruins, or disaster sites and determine what's valuable and what's dangerous. Gain advantage on Investigation checks in such locations.

**Sea Superstition (Sailor)**  
Your superstitious rituals actually work—or coincidentally align with danger. Once per day, you can reroll a failed saving throw if you performed an appropriate ritual that morning.

\page

#### Emberlands Variants

**Fire Resistance (Guild Artisan/Outlander)**  
Exposure to volcanic heat grants you resistance to extreme temperatures. You have advantage on saves against environmental heat and can work comfortably in conditions that would exhaust others.

**Volcanic Crafting (Guild Artisan)**  
You know techniques for working with volcanic materials. You can identify rare minerals by sight and can craft items using geothermal heat when available.

**Endurance Pride (Soldier/Outlander)**  
Emberlands culture values toughness. You can push through exhaustion—once per long rest, you can ignore one level of exhaustion for 1 hour.

#### Verdant Marches Variants

**Green Whispers (Outlander/Hermit)**  
The land speaks to you—sometimes. Once per day, you can ask the DM one yes/no question about the local environment, and receive an intuitive answer.

**Beast Tongue (Outlander/Acolyte)**  
You've learned to communicate basic concepts with natural animals. This isn't magic, just deep understanding of behavior and body language.

**Herbal Expertise (Outlander/Hermit)**  
Marches training makes you an expert in plants. You have advantage on Nature checks related to plants, and can always find basic healing herbs in natural environments.

#### Sunken Dominion Variants

**Deep Diver (Sailor)**  
You can hold your breath for twice as long as normal and have advantage on Athletics checks related to swimming. You're comfortable at depths that terrify others.

**Relic Sense (Sage/Hermit)**  
Exposure to Dominion artifacts gives you intuition about ancient magic. You can sense when an object is magically significant, though not its specific properties.

**Changed by the Deep (Any)**  
The ocean marked you. Choose one minor aquatic feature: gills (can breathe underwater for 10 minutes per day), webbed fingers (swim speed +10 ft), or bioluminescent marks (can produce dim light 5 ft for 1 hour per day).

#### Far North Variants

**Ice Reader (Outlander)**  
You can assess ice safety, predict blizzards, and navigate by stars even in white-out conditions. You have advantage on Survival checks in arctic environments.

**Cold Endurance (Outlander/Soldier)**  
Far North exposure grants you resistance to extreme cold. You can function normally in conditions that would give others exhaustion.

\column

**Ruin Knowledge (Sage/Hermit)**  
You've explored Far North ruins and survived. You recognize Aeorian architectural patterns and can identify similar structures elsewhere. This knowledge unsettles you.

## Tool Proficiencies by Region

Consider regional tool proficiencies that replace or supplement background tools:

**Northreach:** Carpenter's tools, woodcarver's tools, leatherworker's tools  
**Solaris:** Musical instruments, calligrapher's supplies, forgery kit  
**Nullwood:** Herbalism kit, woodcarver's tools, weaver's tools  
**Stonebound:** Smith's tools, mason's tools, jeweler's tools  
**Vharoxis:** Thieves' tools, disguise kit, forgery kit

**Far North:** Survival gear (counts as tool proficiency), leatherworker's tools, cobbler's tools

{{note
##### Tool Proficiency Swap

With DM approval, you can replace one background tool proficiency with a regional tool that better fits your character concept. The mechanical benefit remains the same, but the narrative flavor changes.
}}

## Working With Your DM

Your regional origin creates story opportunities. Discuss with your DM:

**Background Hooks**
- Can regional contacts become quest NPCs?
- Might events from home affect the campaign?
- Are there regional artifacts, rumors, or threats to explore?

**Character Development**
- How does your origin inform character goals?
- What regional ties create compelling drama?
- Which aspects of your culture might evolve through play?

**Party Dynamics**
- How does your origin create interesting friction?
- What can your character teach others about your homeland?
- How do cultural differences enhance team dynamics?

{{note
##### Living, Not Limiting

Your regional origin should inspire your character, not constrain them. You're shaped by where you're from, but you're not defined solely by it. Characters grow, change, and surprise us—including themselves. Let your origin be a starting point, not a straightjacket.
}}

## Conclusion

Aevoria is a vast world of distinct cultures, each shaped by their environment, history, and response to the challenges they face. Your character carries their region with them—in their speech, their values, their skills, and their worldview.

Whether you're a Northreach native defending your home, a Solarian bard seeking truth, a Nullwood scout investigating anomalies, or any of countless other possibilities, your origin grounds your character in the world and provides endless opportunities for meaningful roleplay.

The frontier awaits. Bring your heritage with you, but don't be surprised when Northreach changes you as much as you change it.

**Welcome to the Northwatch Wardens.**
**Your story begins here.**
