## A Player's Guide to Communication and Customs

{{descriptive
##### Words, Gestures, and the Ways of the World

In a world as diverse as Aevoria, knowing the right words—or the right customs—can mean the difference between making an ally and starting a fight. From the frontier pragmatism of Northreach to the artistic flair of Solaris, from the silent halls of the Nullwood to the fire-forged bonds of the Emberlands, each region has its own language, traditions, and unspoken rules.

This guide will help you understand:
- What languages are spoken where
- How to navigate social situations across different cultures
- What customs to respect (and which taboos to avoid)
- How language and culture affect your adventures

Whether you're a frontier native learning to navigate wider Aevoria or a traveler from distant lands adjusting to Northreach's ways, this knowledge will serve you well.

## Why Languages and Culture Matter
}}
### In Gameplay

Understanding languages and culture creates real advantages:

**Communication:** Some conversations happen in languages you might not speak. Knowing Elvish might reveal what the Nullwood scouts are whispering about. Understanding Draconic could help you decipher ancient inscriptions in Vharoxis.

**Social Navigation:** Cultural knowledge affects Charisma-based checks. Respecting a dwarf's hospitality customs might grant advantage on Persuasion. Breaking an Emberlands taboo could impose disadvantage or worse.

**Story Opportunities:** Languages open doors to NPCs, quests, and information. Being able to read Celestial might reveal hidden inscriptions. Speaking Giant could let you negotiate with creatures others would have to fight.

**Roleplay Depth:** Your character's language choices reflect their background, education, and experiences. A character who speaks Undercommon and Thieves' Cant tells a different story than one who speaks Elvish and Celestial.

\column

### In Character Creation

Language choices during character creation matter:

**From Your Race:** Most races grant 1-2 languages automatically (usually Common plus a racial language)

**From Your Background:** Backgrounds often grant 1-2 additional languages of your choice

**From Your Class:** Some classes grant secret languages (druids gain Druidic, rogues gain Thieves' Cant)

**From Your Region:** Where you're from determines which languages are most useful and which you're likely to know

{{note
##### Starting Languages

Most player characters know **2-3 languages** at 1st level:
- Common (nearly universal)
- A racial language (Dwarvish, Elvish, etc.)
- 1-2 choices from backgrounds or class features

Choose languages that fit your character's story and will be useful in the campaign.

# Languages of Aevoria

## Standard Languages

These languages are relatively common and accessible to player characters.
}}
### Common
- **Script:** Common alphabet  
- **Speakers:** Nearly universal  
- **Rarity:** Universal

#### **Who Speaks It:**
Common is the trade language of Aevoria, spoken by humans, half-elves, halflings, and as a second language by most other races. It's the language of commerce, diplomacy, and everyday interaction across the world.

#### **Where It's Used:**
Everywhere. From the frozen frontier of Northreach to the sun-drenched plazas of Solaris, Common is understood by merchants, soldiers, travelers, and townsfolk. Even isolated communities usually have someone who speaks Common.

#### **Written Form:**
The Common alphabet is simple and practical, consisting of 26 letters. Literacy in Common is moderate—perhaps 40-50% of the population can read and write it, with higher rates in cities and lower rates in rural areas.

#### **Practical Uses:**
- Default language for most communication
- Reading contracts, notices, and general documents
- Trade and commerce across all regions

{{note
##### Accents and Dialects

Common has regional accents but remains mutually intelligible:

}}

\column

### Dwarvish

- **Speakers:** Dwarves, some miners and craftspeople  
- **Rarity:** Common in mountains, uncommon elsewhere

**Who Speaks It:**
Native to dwarves of the Stonebound Depths, Dwarvish is the language of stone, metal, and deep earth. It's a precise language with extensive technical vocabulary for crafts, minerals, and construction.

#### **Where It's Used:**
- **Stonebound Depths:** Primary language
- **Northreach:** Uncommon (some craftspeople)
- **Emberlands:** Spoken at Ashfall Hold research outpost
- **Mining communities:** Technical discussions

#### **Practical Uses:**
- Reading runes on ancient stonework
- Communicating with dwarven merchants and craftspeople
- Understanding geomantic and resonance terminology
- Deciphering mining records and craft guild documentation

#### **Cultural Notes:**

}}

### Guest Rights

- Solaris: Until host offers departure gifts

- Nullwood: As long as guest respects silence and customs
- Emberlands: Until next dawn (nomadic culture)

\column

{{note
##### Breaking Hospitality

Violating guest-host customs is one of the most serious social offenses:

**Attacking your host:** Marks you as oath-breaker permanently
**Stealing from host:** Reputation destroyed in all honest communities
**Betraying host's trust:** Word spreads; doors close everywhere
**Host attacking guest:** Loss of honor; may face exile or worse

These violations follow you. In Northreach, a broken hearth-oath is remembered for generations.
}}

### Payment vs. Free Lodging

#### **When to Pay:**
- Inns and taverns (always)
- Professional lodging houses
- Cities and large towns
- When explicitly asked

#### **When Payment Is Insult:**
- Invited into someone's home
- Offered shelter during emergency
- Among friends and allies
- After establishing guest-right

#### **Appropriate Reciprocation:**
- Services (repair, guard duty, storytelling)
- Gifts (see gift-giving section)
- Future hospitality (return the favor)
- Public praise (especially in Solaris)

\column

### Contract and Oath Customs

#### **Binding Force:**

Oaths and contracts carry different weight:

- **Northreach:** Spoken oaths are binding; breaking them destroys reputation. Written contracts for significant transactions.

- **Solaris:** Everything in writing, multiple copies, witnesses. Oral agreements are "preliminary discussions."

- **Stonebound:** Oaths sworn on stone or steel are absolutely binding. Breaking such an oath is cultural anathema.

- **Nullwood:** Oaths sworn before Memory Keepers are magically and culturally binding. Memory itself holds you accountable.

- **Vharoxis:** Written contracts only; spoken promises mean nothing. Even written contracts have exploitable loopholes.

- **Emberlands:** Fire oaths (sworn while touching flame) are unbreakable. Lesser oaths are flexible.

- **Verdant Marches:** Oaths sworn before druids or nature spirits are binding. The land itself witnesses.

### Merchant Guilds

#### **Guild Membership:**
- Guarantees standards and quality
- Provides connections and protection
- Sets prices and trading terms
- Mediates disputes

#### **Notable Guilds:**
- **Waystone Merchants' Alliance** (Northreach): Fair trade, reliable goods
- **Solaris Artisan Consortium:** Luxury goods, artistic items
- **Deepforge Crafters** (Stonebound): Metalwork, stonework, quality tools
- **Verdant Trade Circle:** Natural goods, fair exchange emphasis

- **Scenario:** Nullwood scouts are discussing something in Elvish. Do you understand?
- **Speak Elvish:** You understand; gain information advantage
- **Don't Speak Elvish:** DM gives you basic tone/emotion, but not content
- **Possible Solution:** Comprehend Languages spell, another PC translates, context clues

#### Reading Ancient Inscriptions

- **Scenario:** You find runes carved into stone in the Stonebound Depths.
- **Read Dwarvish:** Instant understanding; possible advantage on related checks
- **Don't Read Dwarvish:** Must find translator or use magic
- **Partial Solution:** History check might give general context; other PCs might help

#### Negotiating with Non-Common Speakers

- **Scenario:** You meet a giant who only speaks Giant.
- **Speak Giant:** Normal social interaction; Charisma checks as usual
- **Don't Speak Giant:** Communication via gestures; disadvantage on Charisma checks, or impossible without magic
- **Solutions:** Tongues spell, translator NPC, creative pantomime

### DM Guidance for Language Barriers

#### **Make It Meaningful:**
- Don't use language barriers to frustrate; use them to create opportunities
- Reward players who chose useful languages
- Provide workarounds (NPCs who translate, magic items, spells)

#### **Balance:**
- Language barriers shouldn't block critical plot progress
- They should create interesting challenges and choices
- Social encounters can become skill challenges or puzzles

### Intimidation Examples

# Final Thoughts

Culture and language are tools for immersion and storytelling. They shouldn't be obstacles that prevent fun—they should be opportunities that create depth. Use this guide to enhance your character's personality, navigate social situations, and engage with the rich diversity of Aevoria.

Remember: Your character's background shapes how they see the world, but it doesn't limit who they can become. A Northreach frontier scout can learn Solaris' artistic traditions. A Solaris bard can earn respect in the Emberlands through strength. Cultural origin is where you start, not where you must end.

Welcome to Aevoria. May your words be well-chosen and your customs respected.
