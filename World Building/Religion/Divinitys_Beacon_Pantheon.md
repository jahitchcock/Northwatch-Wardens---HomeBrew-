# Divinity’s Beacon — Pantheon

Divinity’s Beacon welcomes all good‑aligned gods, but daily life in the city orbits a practical “working pantheon”: a few major multiversal powers everyone recognizes, plus local gods/saints that rose from frontier need.

The city is governed (religiously and politically) by the **Concord of Radiant Thrones**: a council of high priests and order‑masters from the largest temples. No single faith rules the Beacon, but the Concord sets city‑wide standards for vows, sanctuary, and what kinds of magic are tolerated.

## 1) Great Temples (widely known gods)

These are the skyline‑temples: big, old, and influential.

- **Pelor, the Dawnfather** — Sun, Healing, Agriculture
- **Tyr, the Justicar** — Justice, Law, Retribution
- **Moradin, the Soul Forger** — Creation, Smithing, Protection
- **Selûne, the Moonmaiden** — Moon, Navigation, Protection, Hope
- **Lathander, the Morninglord** — Renewal, Birth, Creativity


>- Pelor and Lathander are often allied in civic rituals (oaths at dawn, renewal after tragedy).
>- Tyr sets the legal tone; Moradin equips the orders; Selûne is the city’s “mercy door” (refuge, repentance, lost travelers).

## 2) The Beacon Triad (local patron gods)

These are the three “homegrown” powers most residents feel are *of the Beacon itself*. Their three primary temples form a ceremonial triangle around the central plaza.

### Aurethiel, Dawnmother of Resolve
- **Domains/themes:** Light, Protection, Courage; moral clarity; standing firm against corruption.
- **Worship focus:** public rites, community resilience, vigilance in hard seasons.
- **Common vow:** “Hold the line. Tell the truth. Do not yield to the easy lie.”

### Varrun Stoneheart, the Hearth‑Father
- **Domains/themes:** Life, Forge, Community; craft as service; shelter that endures.
- **Worship focus:** neighborhood hearthposts, communal kitchens, militia chaplains, work‑blessings.
- **Epithet note (merge):** **Aurelian the Hearth‑Warder** is treated as an **epithet/title of Varrun** used by Wardens and frontier folk (when you need “the hearth that guards” more than “the hearth that comforts”).

### Seralyth, the Veiled Listener
- **Domains/themes:** Knowledge, Peace, Truth; confession; secrets kept in trust; oaths with teeth.
- **Worship focus:** confessionals, oath‑binding, counselors, mediators, record‑keepers.
- **Epithet note (merge):** **Vessara, Lady of the Quiet Oath** is treated as an **inner‑mystery title of Seralyth** (a revered mask/aspect invoked for confidential vows, penance, and pact‑severing rites).

## 3) Local Saints & Civic Cults (widely accepted, smaller temples)

These are influential but don’t outrank the Great Temples or the Triad. They often operate as orders within larger faiths.

### Thalanor, the Guiding Gale
- **Domains/themes:** Travel, Pilgrimage, Freedom; crossroads; messengers; “safe roads.”
- **Role in city:** gate‑shrines, caravan blessings, diplomatic neutrality.
- **Merge note:** **Thalanor Brightquill** is kept as **Saint Brightquill**, a famed prophet‑scribe of Thalanor whose cult focuses on inspired speech, diplomacy, and illuminated texts (Knowledge/Light flavor).

### Kelvaris, Warden of the Northern Stars
- **Domains/themes:** Light, Tempest, Navigation; night watch; long patrols; honest bearings.
- **Role in city:** shrines on rooftops, towers, and city walls; patron of scouts and sky‑watchers.

### Myrraline, the Gentle Reclaimer
- **Domains/themes:** Grave, Nature, Renewal; the lawful end; respectful burial; seasons turning.
- **Role in city:** funerary rites, cemetery gardens, anti‑undeath doctrine.

### Eirathene, the Crystal Bloom
- **Domains/themes:** Healing, Growth, Mercy; restoration after crisis; gentle miracles.
- **Role in city:** garden‑hospitals and sanctuaries.
- **Ritual pairing:** In many Beacon rites, **Eirathene and Myrraline** are invoked together as “Bloom and Reclaimer” (life restored, life released).

### Kordun, the Vigilant Flame
- **Domains/themes:** Courage, Sacrifice, Righteous Battle; the will to act when others hesitate.
- **Status (flexible):** treated as either a **minor local god** *or* an **ascended martyr‑saint** depending on which temple tells the story.
- **Role in city:** patron of hardline orders who push strict restrictions on pacts and demon‑tainted magic.

## 4) How worship works in practice

- **House shrines are normal.** A family might honor Pelor at dawn, Seralyth for an oath, and Varrun for a new roof beam.
- **Orders matter more than labels.** “Cleric of Tyr” in the Beacon might be trained by Tyr’s court *and* initiated into Seralyth’s confessional disciplines.
- **The Concord arbitrates conflicts.** When priests disagree, the Concord decides what’s allowed *inside city walls*.

## 5) City stance on arcane magic, warlocks, and pacts

Divinity’s Beacon is not anti‑wizard by default; it is anti‑**unaccountable power**.

- **Arcane study:** tolerated if registered/answerable and not harming innocents.
- **Pacts (warlocks):** the flashpoint. “Good patron” claims are investigated; secret patrons are treated as a civic risk.
- **Seralyth’s role:** confession, truth‑seeking, and oath‑binding are the city’s preferred tools before punishment.
- **Hardliners vs diplomats:** Kordun/Tyr‑aligned orders push bans; Selûne/Thalanor‑aligned factions push monitored tolerance.

## 6) Quick hooks you can drop later

- A Concord vote is split on whether to recognize Kordun as god or saint (political leverage disguised as theology).
- A Seralyth confessor disappears with an oath‑ledger containing names that would start a holy scandal.
- A “Brightquill” preacher is accused of inspiring rebellion via sermons that are secretly encoded.
- A Myrraline funeral rite fails—someone is preventing a soul from “reclaiming,” and the city panics about undeath.
- A Varrun hearthpost is burned; the neighborhood believes it’s a declaration of war.
- An embassy from Solace Nexus arrives asking for sanctuary for a mage accused of pact‑work.
