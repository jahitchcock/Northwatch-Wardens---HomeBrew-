# Religious Practices in Aevoria
*How Faith Works in Daily Life*

Religion in Aevoria is not merely a matter of belief—it shapes daily life, influences commerce, provides social services, and offers tangible benefits through divine magic. This guide explains how worship functions in practice and how your character interacts with the religious institutions of the world.

*For information about specific deities and their mythology, see the Gods and Religion chapter. This guide focuses on practical matters: temple services, costs, holidays, and how faith affects gameplay.*

## How Worship Works

### Daily Devotions

Most faithful people in Aevoria maintain simple daily practices:

**Morning Prayers** (5-10 minutes)
- Brief prayer at dawn or upon waking
- Often includes a small offering (incense, food, water)
- May be done at home altar or temple

**Evening Reflections** (5-10 minutes)
- Gratitude for the day's blessings
- Requests for protection through the night
- Common time for family prayers

**Before Meals**
- Brief thanks for sustenance
- Particularly common among farming communities

**Regular Attendance**
- Weekly temple services (common but not universal)
- Monthly festivals (attendance varies by deity and region)
- Major holidays (most people observe these)

### Cleric and Paladin Characters

If your character is a divine spellcaster, your relationship with faith is deeper:

**Daily Preparation**
- You must spend time in prayer to prepare spells (typically 1 hour at dawn)
- This is when you commune with your deity and regain spell slots
- Failing to pray has mechanical consequences (no spell slots)

**Sacred Oaths and Codes**
- Paladins are bound by specific oaths; breaking them has severe consequences
- Clerics maintain alignment and domain restrictions
- Both must strive to further their deity's goals

**Temple Relationships**
- You're expected to visit temples of your deity when possible
- May be called upon to perform services (healing, ceremonies)
- Have access to temple resources and assistance

## Temple Services and Costs

Temples throughout Aevoria provide various services to the faithful and general public. While healing and divine magic aren't cheap, temples operate on sliding scales to serve communities.

## Divine Magic in Society

### How Common Folk View Magic

**Arcane vs. Divine**
People trust divine magic more than arcane:
- Divine magic comes from gods (understood and sanctioned)
- Arcane magic comes from study or pacts (mysterious and potentially dangerous)
- Clerics are community members; wizards are outsiders or specialists

**Trust in Temple Magic**
- Healing from temples is reliable and safe
- Divine guidance through Augury or Divination is respected (though costly)
- Curses removed by clerics are truly gone (not suppressed)

**Skepticism Varies**
- **High:** Vharoxis (question everything)
- **Moderate:** Urban areas (magic is a tool like any other)
- **Low:** Frontier (magic is rare enough to inspire awe and trust)

### Clerics and Paladins as Authorities

Divine spellcasters hold unofficial authority:

**Social Status**
- Clerics are respected community leaders
- Paladins are viewed as champions and protectors
- Both expected to act morally and help those in need

**Expectations**
- Will heal the injured (for appropriate donation or free if poor)
- Will investigate supernatural threats
- Will mediate disputes fairly
- Will share religious wisdom

**Privileges**
- Given benefit of the doubt in disputes
- Offered hospitality freely
- Sought for counsel and guidance

**Responsibilities**
- Must maintain alignment and divine favor
- Expected to serve community, not just self
- Failures in duty damage reputation significantly

### Temples as Safe Havens

Temples serve as more than houses of worship:

**Community Centers**
- Meeting spaces for important gatherings
- Archives of community history and records
- Schools for basic education (literacy, math, history)

**Social Services**
- Food distribution to the poor
- Orphan care
- Elder support
- Disaster relief

**Information Networks**
- Temples communicate with each other across regions
- Clergy often know about threats, opportunities, news
- May share information with trusted adventurers

**Neutral Ground**
- Disputes can be mediated on temple grounds
- Violence in temples is deeply taboo
- Conflicting parties can meet safely

### Divine Magic and the Law

**Legal Status**
- Divine magic is legal and encouraged throughout Aevoria
- Exception: Vharoxis has no formal stance; anything goes
- Some spells (Speak with Dead, Zone of Truth) may be used in trials

**Restrictions**
- Resurrection magic requires temple approval (prevents abuse)
- Certain curses and dark miracles are forbidden
- Raising undead is universally condemned (evil act)

**Divine Judgment**
In serious matters, divine magic may be invoked:
- Zone of Truth in trials (expensive, rare)
- Augury to guide investigations
- Commune for questions of law interpretation (extremely rare)

Cost and rarity mean divine magic is saved for truly significant cases.

**Life/Death Domain Tension**
- Followers of life-focused deities vs. death domain worshippers

**Civilization vs. Wilderness**

## Religion and Your Character

### Building Religious Background

Consider these questions for your character:

**Faith Level**
- Devout believer (regular temple attendance, daily prayer)
- Casual follower (pray when needed, attend major festivals)
- Respectful skeptic (go through motions for community)
- Secular/agnostic (acknowledge gods exist, don't worship)

**Regional Influence**

- Do you follow regional traditions or rebel against them?

**Personal Experiences**
- Has prayer ever been answered in your character's life?
- Have you witnessed divine magic?
- Do you trust temple authority?

**Practical Matters**
- Which deity do you invoke for different needs?
