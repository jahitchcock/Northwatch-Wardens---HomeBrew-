## The Aeorian Echo

### What It Is
A spreading wave of arcane disturbance emanating from Salsvault and other buried Aeorian facilities. Ancient magic awakening after millennia of dormancy, leaking outward through stone and earth, affecting everything it touches.

### Observable Effects
- **Intelligence awakening** in animals (Welton wolves)
- **Magical corruption** causing disease (Frigid Woe in Palebank)
- **Reality destabilization** causing unpredictable magic (Noke's wand)
- **Construct activation** in ancient sites (Salsvault defenders)
- **Faction mobilization** as powers sense opportunity (Dragonknights)

### Progression Pattern
The Echo spreads in concentric rings from Salsvault, with intensity decreasing by distance but effects growing more complex:

1. **Immediate proximity (Salsvault):** Raw, violent, destructive
2. **Near reach (Palebank):** Direct corruption, illness, environmental damage
3. **Mid-range (Welton, Pinebrook):** Intelligence awakening, social disruption
4. **Far reach (Temple area):** Faction awareness, magical amplification
5. **Frontier edge:** Subtle changes, dismissed as coincidence

### Mystery Structure
The Aeorian Echo operates as the campaign's central mystery, with revelations designed to work in any order:

**Early clues:**
- Strange animal behavior
- Unexplained illness
- Magic malfunctioning
- Ancient sites becoming active

**Mid-campaign revelations:**
- Aeorian origin discovered
- Pattern of spreading effects recognized
- Multiple sites identified
- Faction involvement exposed


**Late-campaign understanding:**
- Full scope of Echo revealed
- Source location confirmed (Salsvault)
- Nature of awakening understood
- Endgame confrontation prepared

### Player Discovery Paths
No matter which adventures players complete first, they accumulate pieces of the puzzle:

- **Wolves of Welton:** Intelligence awakening (symptom)
- **Frozen Sick:** Aeorian spores and active ruins (source)
- **Temple of Dragonknights:** Faction exploitation (consequence)
- **Wild Sheep Chase:** Magic destabilizing (symptom)
- **Peril in Pinebrook:** Community vulnerability (impact)

## Running Northreach

### Atmosphere Guidelines

**Physical Setting:**
- Cold, wind-swept landscapes
- Isolated settlements connected by rough roads
- Dense, dark forests where strange sounds echo
- Distant mountains hiding ancient threats
- Big sky, long horizons, small human presence

**Emotional Tone:**
- Frontier resilience mixed with growing unease
- Pride in self-sufficiency tested by strange threats
- Community bonds strained by inexplicable events
- Hope that problems can be solved... if understood
- Creeping sense that something fundamental is changing

**Pacing:**
- Long travel times create anticipation
- Weather and environment add challenge
- Investigation builds toward revelation
- Action scenes punctuate tension
- Mysteries deepen before resolving

### DM Tools

**Random Encounters:**
Not just combat—chances to showcase Echo effects:
- Wildlife behaving strangely
- Weather anomalies
- Abandoned sites with traces of magic
- Travelers with worrying news
- Natural features subtly wrong

**Rumor Tables:**
Information flows slowly; rumors arrive before truth:
- Village gossip about strange events
- Trader tales from distant places
- Warden reports from other contracts
- Scholar theories about changes
- Folklore suddenly seeming relevant



**Investigation Clues:**
Players should discover connections naturally:
- Physical evidence (spores, tracks, artifacts)
- Witness testimony (consistent details)
- Pattern recognition (multiple incidents)
- Document research (old records, maps)
- Expert consultation (Lorewarden Vael, priests)

### Player Agency

**Meaningful Choices:**
- Which contracts to take (order independence)
- How to resolve conflicts (multiple paths)
- Who to trust (complicated NPCs)
- What to investigate (open exploration)
- How to spend resources (frontier logistics)


**Consequences:**
- Reputation with settlements
- NPC attitudes and alliances
- Resource availability
- Information access
- Long-term regional stability

## Connections to Other Regions

### Trade and Travel

- **Vharoxis:** Black market connections; smuggled goods; criminal networks
- **Stonebound Depths:** Dwarven metalwork; mining techniques; occasional prospectors
- **Shattered Coast:** Maritime trade disrupted; shipwreck salvage; corsair threats

### News and Rumors
Players hear about distant events that echo their own:
- "Eclipse Day in Solaris" matches their magical anomalies
- "Elven scouts watching ruins" mirrors their investigations
- "Dwarven earthquakes" parallels stone tremors
- "Criminal syndicates moving artifacts" connects to their discoveries

### Faction Awareness
Organizations from other regions notice Northreach:
- Scholars from Solaris send inquiries
- Vharoxis smugglers seek artifacts
- Elven scouts observe from distance
- Dwarven geomancers correlate patterns
