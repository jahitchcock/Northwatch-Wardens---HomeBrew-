## Final Note

**Season 1 is intentionally focused.**

Northreach provides rich, self-contained campaign. These broader world secrets are **future tools**, not Season 1 requirements.

**Use them when:**
- Players ask about wider world
- You need flavor details
- Planning future seasons
- Player backstories require it

**Until then:** Focus on Northreach, the Aeorian Echo, and Season 1 adventures.

**The Known World awaits—but Northreach comes first.**
