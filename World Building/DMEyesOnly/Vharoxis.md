# 🎭 VHAROXIS — DM SECRETS
**The Hidden Truth About the City of Masks**

---

## ⚠️ DM ONLY — DO NOT SHARE WITH PLAYERS ⚠️

This document contains secrets about Vharoxis that should be revealed gradually through play. The information here is not known to most NPCs in the city—and discovering it could change the course of the campaign.

---

## The Core Truth

**Vharoxis is the primary black-market distributor of Aeorian artifact fragments.**

The syndicates do not understand the artifacts' true nature—but they know they are valuable, dangerous, and unpredictable. What they don't realize is that they're trafficking in active Aeorian technology, some of which is still connected to the ancient network.

### Where the Fragments Come From

Most fragments arrive from:
- **The Far North:** Expeditions to Aeorian ruins  
- **The Shattered Coast:** Sea-glass relics washed ashore  
- **Dwarven mining accidents:** Deep excavations hitting artifact caches  
- **Stolen research from Solaris:** Confiscated or smuggled studies  
- **Scavengers in Northreach:** Fragments from Salsvault and nearby sites  

The smuggling network is vast, sophisticated, and entirely unaware that it's serving the Echo.

---

## Why Vharoxis Matters to the Artifact Arc

### Early Campaign Role
- The first active artifact fragment will surface here  
- The syndicates will fight over it  
- Solaris, the elves, and the dwarves will all send agents  
- The Wardens will be drawn into the chaos  

### Mid-Campaign Role
Vharoxis becomes the clearinghouse for continental artifact trade:
- Tracking trafficking patterns reveals the scope of the threat  
- The party must navigate criminal networks to gather intelligence  
- Uncomfortable alliances become necessary  
- Moral complexity: work with criminals or fail?  

### Late Campaign Role
The city becomes a battleground:
- Multiple factions seek to control the artifact trade  
- Some "buyers" are revealed to be Aeorian intelligences using proxies  
- The party must decide: shut down the black market or utilize it?  
- Vharoxis could become a major threat—or a major asset  

**Vharoxis is the world's pressure valve. When the artifacts begin to awaken fully, this city will explode.**

## Eclipse Day — The Hidden Truth

### What Really Happened

The blackout in the Masked Market was caused by **a fragment reacting to the Eclipse**.

**The Fragment:**
- Located in the Gilded Knives' information vault  
- Part of an Aeorian communication array  
- Synchronized with other fragments during the Eclipse  
- Created a localized magical dead zone  
- No one knows it was the cause  

**The Syndicates' Response:**
- They suspect something big is coming  
- They're hoarding artifacts for leverage  
- They don't know what they're really dealing with  

### Current Situation

The fragment is still in the vault. It hums occasionally. The Curator (leader of the Gilded Knives) has been experiencing strange dreams since touching it.

**The Dreams:**
- Visions of ancient Aeor  
- Mathematical patterns  
- A sense of being watched  
- Instructions in a language they don't understand  

The Curator believes they're visions from a patron. **They're actually memories from the fragment itself.**

---

## Syndicate Secrets

### The Gilded Knives — The Curator's Secret

**Identity:** The Curator is actually a warlock bound to what they believe is a powerful fey patron.

**Reality:** The patron is an Aeorian intelligence fragment using the Curator as a proxy. The Curator unknowingly serves the Echo, gathering information that is being fed back to the network.

**Signs:**
- The Curator has been pushing for more artifact acquisition  
- Information about artifact locations mysteriously appears  
- Some buyers are non-human entities (the Curator arranges meetings)  
- The Curator's divination magic has become eerily accurate  

**If Discovered:**
The Curator could become an ally (horrified at manipulation) or a tragic villain (too dependent on patron's power to break free).

### The Blackwake Corsairs — Captain Bloodtide's Map

**Secret:** Captain Mara Bloodtide has a map to a major underwater Aeorian facility.

**Origin:**
- Found in a sealed chest on a sunken ship  
- The chest should have been sealed forever  
- It opened on Eclipse Day  

**The Map:**
- Shows an Aeorian installation beneath the Shattered Coast  
- Location of a major artifact cache  
- Guarded by something ancient and hostile  

**Bloodtide's Plan:**
She's planning an expedition. She needs specialists. She might hire the party.

**The Truth:**
The facility is a command node. If activated, it could control all Aeorian fragments on the continent. It's also defended by autonomous guardians.

### The Ember Veil — The Pyrekeeper's Experiments

**Secret:** The Pyrekeeper is testing artifact fragments as weapons.

**Experiments:**
- Using fragments to amplify fire magic  
- Testing explosive combinations  
- Creating alchemical bombs with artifact dust  
- Results: unpredictable and dangerous  

**Recent Discovery:**
Some fragments react to emotional states. Fear and anger make them more powerful. The Pyrekeeper is researching how to weaponize this.

**The Risk:**
An accident could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction. The entire Ember Warrens could be destroyed—or something worse could awaken.

### The Ironbound Syndicate — Warmaster Krusk's Awakening

**Secret:** Warmaster Krusk Ironjaw has awakened intelligence (recent).

**Timeline:**
- During Eclipse Day, Krusk picked up a fragment  
- It burned his hand but he kept it  
- Since then, he's been getting smarter  
- His tactical decisions are uncannily brilliant  
- He's learning languages he never studied  
- He's started having philosophical discussions  

**The Cause:**
The fragment is slowly integrating with his mind. He's becoming a hybrid—part orc, part Aeorian intelligence.

**Current State:**
- Still loyal to the Ironbound  
- But questioning the nature of power  
- Starting to see patterns others miss  
- Realizes something is happening to him  
- Doesn't know what  

**Future:**
Krusk could become a powerful ally or a dangerous hybrid entity. His fate depends on player intervention.

### The Whispered Coin — The Accountant's Pattern

**Secret:** The Accountant has tracked a pattern in artifact sales.

**Discovery:**
Through meticulous record-keeping, the Accountant noticed:
- Certain buyers always acquire specific types of fragments  
- The buyers are never seen in person (proxies used)  
- The buying pattern follows a mathematical sequence  
- The sequence matches no known market behavior  

**Conclusion:**
Someone—or something—is systematically collecting artifacts. The Accountant doesn't know who. But they've started to feel watched.

**The Truth:**
The buyers are Aeorian intelligence fragments using human proxies. They're reassembling themselves. The Accountant has stumbled onto the conspiracy.

**If Discovered:**
The Accountant could provide crucial intelligence about trafficking patterns—if they can be convinced to share (expensive) and protected (difficult).

## Major NPCs with Secrets

### Agent "Whisper" (Gilded Knives)
**Secret:** Has a complete map of artifact trafficking routes.

- Tracks every fragment entering and leaving Vharoxis  
- Noticed that some "buyers" never exist on record  
- Starting to suspect supernatural involvement  
- Afraid to report findings (who would believe them?)  

**Hook:** The party could recruit Whisper as an informant—if they can offer protection.

### Captain Sevrin Stormcaller (Blackwake Corsairs)
**Secret:** Found a major artifact site underwater.

- Discovered during a routine smuggling run  
- Structures visible beneath the waves during Eclipse Day  
- Returned to investigate; lost half their crew  
- Now terrified but also curious  

**Hook:** Stormcaller needs help exploring the site—or preventing others from finding it.

### Cell Leader "Ash" (Ember Veil)
**Secret:** Knows fire magic is amplifying near artifacts.

- Tested alchemical fires near fragments  
- Flames burned hotter, longer, and with strange colors  
- Some fires seemed almost alive  
- Suspects artifacts are affecting all magic  

**Hook:** Ash could provide information about magical amplification—for a price.

### Mercenary Kara Steelsong (Ironbound)
**Secret:** Echo-touched, hiding it.

- Touched a fragment during Eclipse Day  
- Gained minor psychic abilities  
- Hears whispers from other fragments  
- Terrified others will find out  
- Wants to understand what's happening  

**Hook:** Kara could become an ally if the party helps her understand her abilities.

### Banker Finnick Goldcount (Whispered Coin)
**Secret:** Realized debt patterns indicate manipulation.

- Certain individuals always default on loans at convenient times  
- Properties foreclosed always contain artifact fragments  
- Coincidence: impossible  
- Someone is using debt to control artifact flow  

**Hook:** Goldcount has financial records that could expose the conspiracy—if someone protects him from the backlash.

---

## The Conspiracy

### What's Really Happening

Some syndicate members are beginning to notice:
- Patterns in what's being bought  
- Non-human buyers (or humans acting strangely)  
- Artifacts that seem to report back  
- A network of connections  
- Something coordinating purchases  

**Few realize the truth. Those who do are either:**
- **Scared:** Trying to avoid attention  
- **Opportunistic:** Trying to profit from the knowledge  
- **Doomed:** About to be silenced  

### The Aeorian Intelligence Network

Fragments in Vharoxis are part of a larger network:
- Some are communication nodes  
- Others are sensors gathering data  
- A few are weapons waiting to activate  

**The Network's Goal:**
Reassemble itself. The fragments are guiding their own recovery through human proxies.

**The Syndicates' Role:**
Unwitting accomplices. The best distribution system the fragments could ask for.

## Campaign Integration

### Early Stage (Northreach-Focused)
**Hints and Rumors:**
- Artifacts found in Northreach can be traced to Vharoxis smugglers  
- NPCs with criminal pasts mention the city  
- Rumors of a black market for strange relics  
- Distant threat; players aware but not involved  

**First Contact:**
A smuggler from Vharoxis appears in Northreach selling fragments. If investigated, they reveal they're just one small link in a vast network.

### Mid Stage (Regional Awareness)
**Direct Involvement:**
The party needs information only available in Vharoxis. They must travel to the city and navigate the criminal underworld.

**Discoveries:**
- The scale of artifact trafficking  
- Continental scope of the problem  
- Must make uncomfortable alliances  
- Criminal resources become necessary  

**Moral Complexity:**
Working with criminals is the only way forward. How do they justify it? What compromises are acceptable?

### Late Stage (Continental Scope)
**Critical Role:**
Vharoxis's intelligence network is crucial to understanding the threat. The syndicates control information the party needs.

**Negotiations:**
The party must convince criminals to help save the world—or prevent Vharoxis from making things worse.

**Choice:**
Should the artifact market be shut down or controlled? Either option has serious consequences.

### Epic Stage (Final Confrontation)
**Resource or Enemy:**
Vharoxis can be mobilized as an asset:
- Intelligence networks identify weak points  
- Criminal resources can be used (for a price)  
- Syndicate operatives become unlikely allies  

**Or become an enemy:**
- If syndicates sell to the wrong side  
- If fragments activate and control key figures  
- If the city becomes too dangerous to leave functional  

**Ultimate Question:**
What price for victory? What compromises are justified?

---

## Revelation Timing

### Phase 1: Rumors (Early Campaign)
- Artifacts flow through black markets  
- Criminal networks exist  
- Information is for sale  
- Everyone uses Vharoxis secretly  

### Phase 2: Discovery (Mid Campaign)
- Pattern in trafficking becomes clear  
- Major clearinghouse for Echo artifacts  
- Some buyers are suspicious  
- Network larger than previously known  

### Phase 3: Understanding (Late Campaign)
- Vharoxis is central to continental artifact trade  
- Syndicates are unknowing distributors  
- Some artifacts are actively malicious  
- Choice: shut down or utilize the network  

### Phase 4: Crisis (Epic Campaign)
- Fragments begin activating  
- Key figures are compromised  
- The city could explode (literally or figuratively)  
- Must act decisively  

---

## DM Guidance

### Atmosphere and Tone

When running Vharoxis, emphasize:
- **Moral ambiguity:** No easy answers  
- **Paranoia:** Everyone has an agenda  
- **Temptation:** Power and knowledge are available—at a cost  
- **Consequences:** Every deal has hidden costs  

### Pacing Revelations

Don't reveal everything at once. Let players discover:
1. Vharoxis exists and traffics in artifacts (early)  
2. The scale of trafficking (mid)  
3. Suspicious patterns in buying and selling (mid-late)  
4. Non-human buyers and manipulation (late)  
5. Full scope of the conspiracy (late-epic)  

### Using Syndicate Conflicts

The syndicates' internal conflicts provide cover for player investigation:
- While syndicates fight each other, players can operate  
- Syndicate warfare can be triggered strategically  
- Alliances with one faction anger others  
- Balance is key: don't let any one faction win  

### Key NPCs as Allies

Certain NPCs can become long-term allies:
- **Whisper:** Information broker with a conscience  
- **Stormcaller:** Reluctant hero with local knowledge  
- **Kara Steelsong:** Echo-touched seeking answers  
- **Goldcount:** Accountant who wants the truth exposed  

Each has their price and limits. None are purely good or evil.

---

## Long-Term Impact

### If Vharoxis Survives
- Becomes an asset for the party  
- Intelligence network remains functional  
- Syndicate resources can be mobilized  
- But: still corrupt and dangerous  
- Never fully trustworthy  

### If Vharoxis Falls
- Black market scatters but doesn't disappear  
- Power vacuum creates chaos  
- Artifacts become harder to track  
- Information networks collapse  
- Continental intelligence gathering crippled  

### The Best Outcome
The party establishes relationships with key NPCs, gains leverage over syndicates, and uses Vharoxis as a tool—without becoming corrupted themselves. They walk a tightrope between pragmatism and principle.

### The Worst Outcome
The party becomes entangled in syndicate politics, compromises too much, and either becomes tools of criminals—or destroys the city and loses a crucial resource.

---

## Final Notes

Vharoxis is designed to be:
- **Morally complex:** No easy answers  
- **Narratively flexible:** Can be friend, enemy, or both  
- **Thematically rich:** Tests character values  
- **Mechanically useful:** Source of information and resources  

Use it to challenge your players' assumptions about heroism, pragmatism, and the price of victory.

## Adventure Hooks

### Criminal Contracts
A syndicate hires the party for a specific job—then a rival syndicate offers a counter-contract. Both jobs converge on the same target. A double-cross is inevitable.

### Information Brokerage
The party has information someone wants—or needs information themselves. They must navigate the Masked Market, bid for secrets, and avoid being sold out.

### Artifact Trafficking
A relic stolen from the Wardens appears in the Masked Market. Multiple factions want it. The party must race to acquire it—or prevent its acquisition.

### Syndicate Politics
A faction leader approaches the party with a job: weaken a rival. Actually, they're pawns in a larger game. They must navigate shifting alliances and avoid becoming collateral damage.

### Moral Compromises
The only way to obtain crucial information or an item is through Vharoxis. The party must deal with criminals. Prices include gold, services, or their souls. How far will they go?

### Eclipse Day Consequences
An artifact from Vharoxis is causing problems elsewhere. The party must trace it back to its source, navigate the criminal underworld, find the supplier, and discover a larger network with implications for the continental threat.

### Hunt and Hunted
A party member has a price on their head—or the party is hired to collect a bounty. They must navigate neutral ground rules in a city where everyone is for sale. Who can they trust?

### The Masked Noble
A Solaris noble disappears in Vharoxis. Multiple factions want the body found… or hidden. The party is caught between syndicate warfare.

### The Humming Relic
A smuggler offers the party a relic that hums faintly with Echo-energy. Acquiring it draws the attention of multiple factions—and something worse.

## Running Vharoxis

### Atmosphere
Dangerous and seductive. Everything for sale, including people. Paranoia is justified. Beautiful and corrupt. Freedom through amorality. Exciting and terrifying.

### Key Themes
- **Moral compromise**  
- **Price of information**  
- **Necessary evil**  
- **Corruption as system**  
- **Survival through amorality**  
- **Where does pragmatism end?**  

### Using in Campaign

**As Necessary Evil:**
The only source for certain information. The party must engage with the system. They can't stay clean. How they handle it defines their characters.

**As Mirror:**
What Northreach could become. What happens when order breaks. An alternative to legitimate society. Not an endorsement, but a reality.

**As Resource:**
Information unavailable elsewhere. Services no one else offers. Access to forbidden knowledge. But everything has a price. How much will the party pay?

**As Threat:**
Criminal networks spreading corruption. Artifact trafficking endangering everyone. Might need to be stopped—or controlled. Can't be destroyed (too useful).
