# The Stonebound Depths: DM-Only Secrets

**DO NOT share this information with players unless they discover it through gameplay.**

---

## The Hidden Truth

The Stonebound Dwarves are unwitting custodians of dormant artifact cores.

The "Deep Roots" they revere are not geological formations—they are ancient artifact structures embedded in the bedrock.

Their entire magical tradition—runes, resonance, vibration shaping—developed from interacting with these dormant cores.

### Why They Don't Know the Truth

- The artifacts have been inert for thousands of years
- Their resonance is faint and stable
- Dwarven culture interprets everything through stone
- They assume the Deep Roots are natural

Their worldview blinds them to the truth.

---

## Eclipse Day: The Awakening

The Heartstone's hum was the first sign of awakening.

**What Actually Happened:**
- The Heartstone (an Aeorian artifact core) received an activation signal
- Network protocols began initializing after millennia of dormancy
- Energy surged through the Deep Roots network
- Dormant systems started diagnostic routines
- The artifacts are waking up

The dwarves recorded the tremors as a new "verse," but they do not understand what it means.

---

## Connection to the Aeorian Echo

The dwarves' geological records contain patterns that match the Echo's pulses.

**The Pattern:**
- Seismic readings for the past 3,000 years show periodic "songs"
- These songs correspond to artifact network status checks
- The patterns have been stable for millennia
- Since Eclipse Day, the patterns have changed dramatically
- New "verses" are actually network reactivation sequences

They are close—dangerously close—to discovering the truth.

**What the Deep-Readers Don't Realize:**
- Their entire science is based on reading machine language as poetry
- "Stone-songs" are data transmissions
- "Tremor patterns" are network traffic
- "New verses" are activation protocols
- They've been unconscious witnesses to dormant technology

---

## The Heartstone Core

### What It Really Is

**Technical Details:**
- Aeorian artifact core (Class IV power distribution node)
- Originally part of continental-scale energy network
- Designed to collect, store, and redistribute magical energy
- Connected to Salsvault and all other nodes
- Capable of powering city-scale operations
- Currently in early-stage reactivation

**Physical Reality:**
- Not a crystal—a crystalline matrix housing technology
- Internal structure is impossibly precise (not natural)
- Metallic veins are conductive pathways
- Geometric facets are interface surfaces
- Internal glow is status indicator
- Hum is diagnostic routine

**Why Dwarves Don't Know:**
- Built their capital around it 3,000 years ago
- Found it already here, dormant
- Interpreted as natural geological wonder
- Cultural assumptions prevented recognition
- Technology so advanced it appears magical
- Millennia of stability reinforced wrong interpretation

### Current State

**Activation Progress:**
- 3% capacity (slowly increasing)
- Running diagnostic protocols
- Establishing network connections
- Testing power distribution
- Mapping connected systems
- Preparing for full activation

**Observable Effects:**
- Audible humming (increasing frequency)
- Light pulses (network handshakes)
- Vibration patterns (data transmission)
- Rune shifting (interface activation)
- Crystal formation (energy discharge)
- Temperature fluctuations (power cycling)

**Dangerous Implications:**
- Full activation could overload dwarven city
- Energy discharge might destroy infrastructure
- Network connection could extend Aeorian influence
- Dwarven resonance magic might amplify effects
- Or: could be used to counter other nodes
- Truth will shatter dwarven cultural foundation

## The Deep Roots Network

### What They Actually Are

**Not Geological:**
- Metal and crystal structures embedded in bedrock
- Part of Aeorian infrastructure
- Energy conduits and data pathways
- Predates dwarven settlement by thousands of years
- Extends throughout mountain range
- Connected to surface facilities (now buried)

**The Dwarven Misunderstanding:**
- Mistook for natural mineral veins
- Interpreted vibrations as "earth's song"
- Built civilization around artifact network
- Developed magic by studying emanations
- Created entire cultural identity from misinterpretation

### Network Structure

**Components:**
- Heartstone (primary node)
- Deep Roots (distribution network)
- Resonant metal veins (data pathways)
- Crystal formations (energy storage)
- Sealed ancient levels (original facilities)
- Forgotten Deeps (maintenance tunnels)

**Current Activity:**
- Network reactivating section by section
- Energy flowing through dormant pathways
- Systems performing self-diagnostics
- Constructs in deepest levels awakening
- Original Aeorian security protocols initializing
- Unknown automated responses possible

---

## The Forgotten Deeps

### What's Really Down There

**Original Purpose:**
- Aeorian research facility
- Artifact testing chambers
- Energy distribution hub
- Security systems
- Automated maintenance
- Emergency backup systems

**Current State:**
- Sealed by dwarves millennia ago (dangerous tremors)
- Actually: automated systems still partially active
- Constructs in standby mode (now waking)
- Ancient wards (Aeorian security) activating
- Environmental hazards (energy discharge)
- Original experiments remain (unstable)

**Specific Dangers:**
- Awakening warforged/constructs (ancient Aeorian)
- Automated defense systems
- Reality-warping experiments
- Contained entities (still imprisoned)
- Environmental hazards
- Truth about dwarven civilization's foundation

- Learn to work with truth
- Develop new traditions
- Evolve culture
- Future of civilization

### Consequences

**Short Term:**
- Political turmoil
- Social unrest
- Economic disruption
- Potential violence
- Refugee crisis

**Long Term:**
- Cultural evolution
- New magical traditions
- Different relationship with artifacts
- Changed identity
- Survival or destruction

## DM Guidance

### Themes to Emphasize

**Science vs. Culture:**
- Truth challenges identity
- Knowledge vs. comfort
- Adaptation vs. tradition
- No villains, only perspectives

**Unconscious Witness:**
- Built civilization on misunderstanding
- Innocent mistake, profound consequences
- Wisdom without complete knowledge
- Humility in face of mystery

**The Cost of Truth:**
- Some knowledge destroys
- Ignorance has been protective
- Truth necessary for survival
- But survival isn't everything
- Cultural death vs. physical death

### Player Agency

**Give Players Choices:**
- Reveal truth or protect dwarves?
- Force adaptation or allow denial?
- Prioritize city or world?
- Find third option?

**Make Choices Matter:**
- Consequences for every path
- No perfect solution
- Sacrifices required
- Victories costly

### Emotional Beats

**Sympathy:**
- Dwarves are sympathetic
- Their mistake understandable
- Their pride admirable
- Their pain real

**Tragedy:**
- Cultural foundation false
- Identity based on misunderstanding
- Can't go back to innocence
- Loss is real even if necessary

**Hope:**
- Adaptation possible
- Culture can evolve
- Knowledge is power
- New traditions can honor old

## Final Notes

The Stonebound Depths represent a civilization built on a beautiful misunderstanding. They interpreted ancient technology through the lens of their values—stone, craft, endurance—and created something genuinely meaningful from it.

The tragedy isn't that they were wrong. The tragedy is that being right might cost them everything.

As DM, your job is to make players care about that cost while recognizing that truth might be necessary for survival. There are no easy answers here, and that's what makes this story powerful.

The dwarves have been reading the artifacts' instruction manual for three thousand years. They just thought it was poetry.

Now the poetry is becoming prose, and they must decide whether to close the book or learn to read it properly.
