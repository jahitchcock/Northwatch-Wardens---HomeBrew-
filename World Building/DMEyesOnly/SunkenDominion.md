# The Sunken Dominion: DM-Only Secrets

**DO NOT share this information with players unless they discover it through gameplay.**

---

## The Hidden Truth

The Sunken Dominion is not a drowned mortal civilization.

It is the oceanic branch of the ancient artifact network—a megastructure spanning the ocean floor, built long before Aeor, long before elves or dwarves, long before any known culture.

---

## What the Dominion Actually Is

### Not a Civilization
The "ruins" are not the remnants of buildings, cities, or settlements. They are:
- A lattice of submerged artifact nodes
- A network of conduits channeling energy across the world
- A biological and arcane experimentation zone
- A stabilizing system for the planet's magical field

The structures serve purposes that mortal civilizations never imagined.

### The Artifact Network
The Dominion is part of the same system as:
- **Salsvault** (The Far North) — Primary control node
- **The Heartstone** (Stonebound Depths) — Geomantic resonance hub
- **The Deep Roots** (Stonebound) — Terrestrial conduit network
- **The Nullwood Silence** — Suppression field (elven response to network)

All of these are connected. All are awakening simultaneously.

### Its True Purpose
The Dominion was designed to:
- Regulate oceanic magical currents
- Monitor and stabilize planetary ley lines
- Conduct experiments on marine life adaptation
- Serve as energy distribution hub for coastal regions
- Maintain communication nodes across the ocean floor

It was infrastructure, not habitation.

## Why It's Drowned

### It Was Always Underwater

The Dominion was never on land. The sea did not swallow it. It was built beneath the waves.

**Why?**
- The builders needed to access deep-earth energy conduits
- Ocean currents provide natural cooling for energy systems
- Pressure differentials power certain artifact functions
- Marine environment ideal for biological experiments
- Isolation from surface disruption

The Dominion was an underwater laboratory and power station.

### The Architecture
What appear to be "towers" are:
- Energy transmission antennae
- Sensor arrays
- Vertical access shafts
- Experimental growth chambers
- Communication relay stations

What appear to be "cities" are:
- Organized node clusters
- Maintenance sectors
- Processing facilities
- Storage arrays
- Experimental zones

None of it was designed for living beings to inhabit—at least, not beings like humans, elves, or dwarves.

## Why Relics Wash Ashore

As the artifacts awaken, the Dominion experiences system failures and overloads.

### The Process
1. **Pressure changes:** Energy buildup destabilizes containment systems
2. **Currents shift:** Network activation alters oceanic flow patterns
3. **Fragments break loose:** Old structures fail under new stresses
4. **Dormant constructs rise:** Maintenance systems activate and surface
5. **Glowing debris drifts upward:** Energy discharge creates buoyancy

The artifacts weren't meant to leave the network, but the awakening is chaotic.

### What the Relics Actually Are
Most "relics" are:
- Component fragments from larger systems
- Experimental subjects (preserved organisms)
- Diagnostic tools
- Data storage crystals
- Energy regulators
- Biological interfaces
- Failed prototypes

They look like art, jewelry, or sculptures because humans interpret them through a cultural lens. They're actually pieces of ancient technology.

## The Drowned Gate

### What It Actually Is

The Drowned Gate is not an archway or monument. It is:
- A sealed access point to deeper network layers
- A maintenance portal for the entire oceanic system
- A failsafe containment mechanism
- A lock

### What It Guards

Beyond the Gate lies:
- Primary oceanic network hub
- Master control systems for all underwater nodes
- Experimental vaults (sealed for good reason)
- Energy storage reserves
- Something the builders locked away

The symbols on the Gate are not decorative. They are:
- Status indicators
- Warning labels
- Lock mechanisms
- System diagnostics
- Fail-safe protocols

### Why It's Responding

The Gate is responding to the awakening pulses from the Far North (Salsvault).

**The sequence:**
1. Salsvault sends activation signal
2. Network nodes receive and relay
3. The Gate recognizes the signal as legitimate
4. Lock protocols begin initialization
5. Symbols glow as systems power up
6. Seals start to weaken

The Gate isn't opening because someone wants it to. It's opening because the network commands it to.

---

## Eclipse Day: What Really Happened

### The Technical Truth

Eclipse Day was a network synchronization event.

**What occurred:**
- Salsvault sent a powerful pulse across the network
- All artifact nodes responded simultaneously
- The Dominion experienced massive energy surge
- Systems that had been dormant for millennia activated
- Network diagnostics ran for the first time in ages
- The entire oceanic grid synchronized

The glowing currents were **energy discharges**.  
The whirlpool was a **pressure vent**.  
The Glassspires lit up because the **network briefly synchronized**.

### The Aftermath

Since Eclipse Day:
- Network stability is increasing
- Systems are coming online in sequence
- Energy levels are building
- Diagnostic routines are running continuously
- The Gate's seals are weakening
- Dormant constructs are activating

This was the first sign that the oceanic nodes are waking.

---

## The Glowing Currents

### What They Actually Are

The currents aren't bioluminescent organisms or magical phenomena. They are:
- Visible energy flow through oceanic conduits
- Network traffic visualization
- Power distribution in liquid medium
- Communication pathways
- System status indicators

The glow is a side effect of energy moving through water.

### Why They Pulse

The rhythmic pulse is:
- Network heartbeat
- System synchronization timing
- Data packet transmission
- Energy regulation cycle
- Diagnostic ping

The pulse is getting faster because network activity is increasing.

### Why They're Dangerous

The currents carry:
- Raw magical energy
- Activation commands
- Corrupted data
- System errors
- Experimental overflow

Exposure causes:
- Magical contamination
- Mental influence
- Physical mutation
- Obsessive behavior
- Network connection

Divers who spend too long in the currents start to resonate with the network.

---

## The Coral Labyrinth

### Not Natural Growth

The coral formations aren't natural. They are:
- Biological experiments that succeeded
- Self-replicating structures
- Living interfaces
- Organic computing substrate
- Hybrid life forms

The builders created organisms that could grow in patterns determined by the network.

### The Patterns

The "unnatural" patterns are:
- Circuit layouts
- Data storage structures
- Antenna arrays
- Filter systems
- Access pathways

The labyrinth isn't a maze. It's organized infrastructure grown instead of built.

### Why It's Growing

Since Eclipse Day, growth has accelerated because:
- Network activation triggered growth programs
- Energy influx feeds the organisms
- System expansion requires more substrate
- Diagnostic routines need sensor networks
- The coral is doing what it was designed to do

It will continue growing until someone stops it—or until it completes its pattern.

---

## The Missing Divers

### What Happened to Them

Most didn't die. They were:
- **Absorbed:** Incorporated into hybrid experiments
- **Converted:** Transformed into network interfaces
- **Recruited:** Mentally connected to the network
- **Relocated:** Transported to sealed sectors
- **Archived:** Preserved for study

The Dominion doesn't kill unnecessarily. It repurposes.

### The Changed Ones

Some divers return, but they're not the same. They have been:
- Partially networked
- Mentally influenced
- Physically altered
- Mission-encoded
- Made into unknowing agents

They don't know what happened to them. They only know they need to go back.

### Captain Mira Saltwind

Mira is already partially connected. Her dreams are network communications. Her diving "instinct" is network guidance. Her obsession is programming.

She's becoming a bridge between the Dominion and the surface world.

Eventually, she'll complete the connection.

## The Abyssal Steps

### What They Lead To

The Steps descend to:
- Deepest network hub
- Master control chamber
- Primary experimentation vault
- Builder archive
- The source of everything

Each step is perfectly carved because they were never carved. They were **grown** or **formed** by the network.

### Why They're So Large

The Steps weren't built for humans. They were built for:
- Maintenance constructs (enormous)
- Biological experiments (various sizes)
- Energy beings (formless)
- The builders themselves (unknown form)

Whatever built this network, they weren't human-shaped.

### What Lives There

At the bottom of the Steps:
- Dormant constructs (awakening)
- Failed experiments (sealed)
- Successful experiments (thriving)
- Network guardians (active)
- Something the builders left behind (unknown)

No one has reached the bottom and returned. Yet.

---

## The Glassspire Ruins

### Not Crystal, Not Towers

The Glassspires are:
- Energy transmission arrays
- Sensor networks
- Communication relays
- Atmospheric interface points
- Surface monitoring stations

They rise from the seabed to breach the surface because they need to connect oceanic and atmospheric energy flows.

### Why They Refract Light

The "crystal" is:
- Metamaterial designed to focus energy
- Sensor arrays interpreting electromagnetic spectrum
- Data visualization made physical
- Communication through light patterns
- Side effect of energy processing

The kaleidoscopic displays are network traffic visualized through light refraction.

### What Happens When They're Fully Active

If the Glassspires reach full activation:
- They'll transmit energy to atmosphere
- Weather patterns will be controlled
- Communication range will be global
- Other networks will receive signals
- The world will know something is active

They're antennae broadcasting to the sky.

## The Ultimate Truth

The Dominion, Salsvault, the Heartstone, and all the "ancient ruins" across the world are not separate civilizations.

They are one system.

One network.

One ancient infrastructure built by beings whose purposes remain unknown.

The "awakening" isn't random. It's systematic reactivation of a world-spanning megastructure.

And no one alive remembers why it was built—or why it was shut down.
