# 🌊 THE SHATTERED COAST — DM SECRETS
**The Hidden Truth About the Maritime Frontier**

---

This document contains secrets about the Shattered Coast that should be revealed gradually through play. The information here is not known to most NPCs — and discovering it could change the course of the campaign.

---

## The Core Truth

**The Shattered Coast is one of the primary distribution points for artifact fragments drifting south from the Far North.**

The coastal communities do not understand what's happening. They see fragments washing ashore, strange currents, and impossible phenomena — but they don't realize they're witnessing the awakening of an ancient Aeorian network beneath the ocean floor.

---

## Why Fragments Wash Ashore

As the artifacts begin to awaken:
- **Dormant nodes beneath the ocean floor destabilize**  
- **Currents shift** in response to energy flows  
- **Fragments break loose** from sediment and ruins  
- **Glowing debris rises** from the depths, carried by artificial currents  

These fragments are:
- Unpredictable in their effects  
- Dangerous to handle without knowledge  
- Highly sought after by Vharoxis smugglers  
- Misunderstood by coastal druids (who sense power but not purpose)  
- Feared by storm-priests (who recognize unnatural magic)  

**The fragments are not inert relics. They are components of an active system.**

## The Gravewater Trench

### What Lies Beneath

The Gravewater Trench contains:

**A partially submerged Aeorian megastructure**  
Vast and still partially functional, this facility extends deep into the ocean floor. It was designed to survive catastrophic events — and it did.

**Dormant artifact conduits**  
Network connections that once linked this facility to others across Aevoria. They are beginning to reactivate, creating the glowing currents visible from the surface.

**Ancient constructs trapped in silt**  
Preservation protocols kept them dormant for millennia. Now, with power returning, some are beginning to stir.

**A core node beginning to pulse**  
The heart of the facility. Its awakening is causing all the coastal anomalies. Each pulse sends energy through the network — and artifacts respond.

### The Oceanic Counterpart

The Gravewater Trench is to the ocean what Salsvault is to Northreach:
- A major Aeorian facility  
- A nexus point in the artifact network  
- A source of fragments and anomalies  
- A location that will eventually need to be explored  
- A threat that grows stronger with time  

**But the Trench is bigger. And it's more intact.**

## Eclipse Day — The Hidden Truth

### What Really Happened

The glowing currents were caused by **a pulse from the submerged artifact node**.

**The Pulse:**
- Synchronized with Eclipse Day events across Aevoria  
- Activated dormant systems in the underwater facility  
- Sent a status report through the network  
- Received a response from other nodes  
- Established communication protocols  

**This was the first sign that the oceanic artifacts are awakening.**

### The Shipwreck with No Crew

The vessel found on shore was:
- Passing directly over the Gravewater Trench during Eclipse Day  
- Caught in an energy discharge from below  
- The crew was not killed — they were **taken**  
- Pulled underwater by constructs following retrieval protocols  
- The constructs mistook humans for Aeorian personnel  

**The crew is still alive, trapped in air-filled chambers deep in the facility.**

The party could potentially rescue them — if they can reach the depths and navigate the reactivating systems. The crew has learned things down there. Things about what the facility was built to do.

## Long-Term Role in the Campaign

### Early Campaign

The Shattered Coast becomes:
- A source of mysterious artifacts washing ashore  
- An early warning of the ocean's involvement  
- A connection point between Northreach and broader world  
- A place where the Wardens hear rumors of deeper mysteries  

### Mid-Campaign

The coast becomes:
- A battleground for relic trafficking  
- A source of intelligence about the artifact network  
- A region where Corsair knowledge proves valuable  
- A place where uncomfortable alliances must be forged  

### Late Campaign

The coast represents:
- A maritime front of the artifact awakening  
- A region where the sea itself begins to behave strangely  
- A location where the Wardens will uncover clues about oceanic nodes  
- A potential disaster zone if the Trench facility fully activates  

### Epic Campaign

The Shattered Coast could become:
- A major threat if oceanic facilities rise  
- A source of underwater technology and knowledge  
- A battleground requiring naval cooperation

## Key NPCs and Their Secrets

### Captain Mara Bloodtide (Blackwake Corsairs)

**Public Face:**  
Ruthless pirate captain, leader of the Blackwake Corsairs, profit-driven and amoral.

**Hidden Truth:**  
Mara lost her entire original crew to an underwater anomaly five years ago. She survived but saw things down there — structures, lights, movement. She's been quietly investigating ever since, trying to understand what killed her crew.

**Knowledge:**
- Has a rough map of underwater anomaly zones  
- Knows the safest routes (and most dangerous)  
- Suspects something ancient is down there  
- Will work with party if they prove competent  
- Price: Help her understand what she saw  

**Secret:** She has a fragment of Aeorian metal she recovered from the site of her crew's death. It hums when she's near the ocean. She doesn't know what it means.

### Storm-Priest Veyara (Breakwater Haven)

**Public Face:**  
Respected spiritual leader, weather forecaster, provider of blessings.

**Hidden Truth:**  
Veyara's storm-magic has been growing stronger since Eclipse Day — but so have her nightmares. She dreams of drowning, of breathing water, of voices singing in a language she shouldn't understand but somehow does.

**Knowledge:**
- Recognizes the storms are not natural  
- Knows the traditional omens are failing  
- Suspects divine or primal forces awakening  
- Seeks answers desperately  
- Will aid party if they investigate  

**Secret:** Her connection to the sea is changing. She's developing abilities she shouldn't have — like breathing underwater briefly, or sensing things in the depths. She's terrified this means she's being chosen for something.

### Elder Torwin (Tide's Rest)

**Public Face:**  
Ancient druid, leader of the Elder Circle, keeper of traditions.

**Hidden Truth:**  
Torwin has been alive for over two hundred years through druidic longevity. He remembers stories from his predecessors — stories of "when the sea was awake." He recognizes what's happening now matches those ancient tales.

**Knowledge:**
- Knows the ocean was once "alive" with intelligence  
- Believes it's awakening again  
- Has fragments of old lore about "singing stones" underwater  
- Knows ritual sites that correspond to underwater structures  
- Will share knowledge if party proves worthy  

**Secret:** The druids of Tide's Rest have been serving as unknowing caretakers for the underwater facility. Their rituals have actually been maintaining dormant systems. Now those systems are reactivating — and the druids' magic is being drained to fuel them.

## Running the Shattered Coast

### Atmosphere

- Beautiful but deadly  
- Ocean as a character — mysterious, powerful, waking  
- Tension between profit and survival  
- Ancient things stirring beneath waves  
- Time running out  

### Key Themes

- **The unknowable deep** — mysteries beneath the surface  
- **Profit vs. preservation** — salvage temptation vs. safety  
- **Nature vs. artifice** — the sea's awakening is not natural  
- **Communication breakdown** — the sea "speaks" but who understands?  
- **Rising tide** — threat growing inexorably  

### Foreshadowing the Threat

**Early Signs:**
- Fragments with recognizable patterns  
- Survivors describing underwater structures  
- Navigation magic failing  
- Marine life behaving intelligently  
- Compulsion effects near certain waters  

**Medium Signs:**
- Constructs emerging briefly  
- Entire ships vanishing  
- Underwater lights visible at night  
- Temperature and current impossibilities  
- "Singing" heard underwater  

**Late Signs:**
- Surface structures manifesting  
- Direct attacks from below  
- Weather control becoming obvious  
- Evacuations necessary  
- Regional crisis

## Connection to the Broader Campaign

### The Aeorian Echo

The Shattered Coast is a major node in the Echo. The underwater facility is:
- Part of the same network as Salsvault  
- Possibly more advanced due to preservation  
- A test of the party's adaptability  
- A source of vital intelligence  
- A threat that cannot be ignored  

### Other Regions

**Vharoxis:**  
Will traffic artifacts from the coast. The party may need to work with criminals to track fragment movement.

**Solaris:**  
Will send expeditions to investigate. The party may ally with or compete against Solarian scholars.

**Northreach:**  
Will provide context. The party can compare coastal anomalies to Salsvault effects and recognize patterns.

**The Far North:**  
The ultimate source. Understanding the coast helps understand the broader awakening.

## Adventure Seeds

### The Singing Depths

The druids of Tide's Rest hire the party to investigate why their magic is being drained. Trail leads to underwater structure that's "singing" — actually data transmission that sounds like music. Party must decide whether to shut it down, study it, or leave it alone.

### The Missing Crew

Rumors suggest the crew from the Eclipse Day shipwreck might still be alive, trapped underwater. Corsairs offer to help rescue them — for a price. The crew has information about the facility that could be vital.

### The Fragment War

Multiple factions compete for a powerful fragment that washed ashore. Party must navigate political intrigue, theft, violence, and moral complexity to determine who should have it — or if anyone should.

### Storm-Priest's Visions

Veyara seeks help interpreting her nightmares. Party investigates, discovers she's being affected by proximity to awakening artifacts. Must find way to protect her or help her understand her transformation.

### The Corsair's Map

Captain Bloodtide offers a deal: she'll share her map of underwater anomalies if the party helps her understand what killed her crew. Investigation reveals larger pattern — and suggests the facility is much bigger than anyone realized.

### The Drowned Temple

A ritual site used by Tide's Rest druids is flooding. Elder Torwin asks party to investigate. Site turns out to be directly above a facility access point. Party must decide whether to seal it or explore it.

*"The sea remembers. The sea awakens. And the sea has plans we do not understand."*

## Adventure Hooks

### A Relic from the Deep

A shipwreck washes ashore carrying a relic that hums with Echo-energy. Multiple factions want it — Solaris scholars, Vharoxis smugglers, the Blackwake Corsairs, and Tide's Rest druids. The party must decide who gets it — or keep it themselves.

### The Glowing Currents

A storm-priest hires the party to investigate glowing currents beneath the waves. The expedition reveals structures far below — ancient, active, and aware of intruders.

### Diplomatic Disaster

Pirates seize a Solaris diplomat traveling by sea. Multiple factions want them rescued… or silenced. The party must navigate political intrigue while racing against time.

### The Missing Salvage Crew

A salvage crew disappears near the Gravewater Trench. Their last message spoke of "singing" from below. The party is hired to investigate — and discovers something down there is calling to people.

### The Sea Remembers

Tide's Rest druids claim the sea is "remembering something." They hire the party to investigate a specific coastal location where the memories are strongest. What they find suggests the ocean itself has a history — and an agenda.

### Corsair Complications

The party needs passage along the coast. Only the Blackwake Corsairs are willing to sail these dangerous waters — for a price. The price involves a job that's far more dangerous than advertised.

### The Lighthouse Mystery

A lighthouse keeper goes missing, but the light continues to function. Investigation reveals the keeper's journal documenting strange underwater phenomena — and suggestions that something is watching from below.

*"The sea doesn't forgive. It doesn't forget. And lately, it doesn't sleep."*

— Storm-Priest Veyara of Breakwater Haven
