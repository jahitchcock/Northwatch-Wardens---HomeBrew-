# Solace Nexus (Draft)

Status: draft / future expansion.

## Concept
- A warm southern valley city that’s hard to reach and not a traditional seaport.
- Feels like a “port” of ley lines: a convergence/hub point for travel and exchange of magical energy rather than ships.

## Wizard-adjacent economy
- Component suppliers, scribes, scroll-makers, alchemists, and craftsmen who profit off the wizard community.

## Shadow layer
- Rumors of darker alleys and hidden circles where warlocks and pact-makers gather.
- Useful hook: “old pacts were made here” and the consequences still echo.
