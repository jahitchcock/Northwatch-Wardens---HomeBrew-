# Divinity's Beacon (Draft)

Status: draft / future expansion.

## Concept
A major holy city that welcomes all good-aligned gods (no single state religion), but still stands in ideological opposition to permissive arcane enclaves—especially communities that shelter warlocks or tolerate morally gray magic.

## Built-in party tension
- Paladins/clerics can have roots and allies here.
- Wizards/warlocks may be viewed with suspicion depending on patron, methods, and past deeds.
