# The Nullwood Elves (Draft — Off-map World Lore)

Status: draft. Not part of Northreach Season One canon unless explicitly adopted.

## Player version (safe / in-world)
The elves of the Nullwood are a quiet, introspective people who settled in a region where magic feels strangely calm. Their homeland is known for muted forests, still air, and an almost sacred sense of silence.

Elven stories speak of a time long ago when their ancestors fled “the world’s great noise,” seeking refuge in a place untouched by the strange relics scattered across the world.

Though they rarely speak of it directly, the elves avoid ancient ruins and artifact sites with a seriousness that borders on superstition. Their scouts monitor such places from afar, but they do not interfere. Their magic is subtle and controlled, shaped by a cultural belief that power should be quiet, deliberate, and respectful of the world’s balance.

The Nullwood Elves are known for:
- Calm, disciplined magic
- A deep connection to memory and emotion
- A preference for harmony over spectacle
- A cautious attitude toward ancient relics

They are not isolationists, but they are careful—and they carry a sense of history that feels older than their long lives alone can explain.

### Eclipse Day (player-facing)
The Nullwood fell silent in a way that frightened even its own people.

Neither the elves nor outsiders fully agree what it meant; most believe it echoes something ancient.

## DM version (truth / behind the curtain)
### The Nullwood Elves — refugees of the first awakening
Long before written history, the elves lived near several ancient artifacts. They witnessed the first stirrings of their power—not a full awakening, but enough to warp magic, twist memories, and destabilize reality around them.

The elves barely survived.

Their leaders made a desperate choice:
- They fled to a region where the artifacts’ influence could not reach.
- They pruned their own memories to prevent panic and cultural collapse.
- They built a society around magical restraint and emotional discipline.

Over millennia, the truth became myth, then metaphor, then superstition.

**What the elves believe today:**
“The world once sang too loudly, and we fled the noise.”

**What actually happened:**
They fled the first signs of artifact awakening.

**Why they don’t know the truth:**
Their ancestors intentionally erased it.

**How Eclipse Day affected them:**
For a moment, the Nullwood’s magical silence cracked. Old fears resurfaced. Some elves felt echoes of memories they were never meant to recall.

## Vaeltharyn, the Quiet Crown (capital)
### Overview
Vaeltharyn is built in the heart of the Nullwood, where magic is muted and the air carries a serene stillness. It’s a place of soft light, quiet pathways, and architecture that blends into the forest’s natural contours—ancient, but like a memory preserved in amber.

Everything about Vaeltharyn reflects the elves’ philosophy: **avoidance of magical excess, reverence for silence, and a deep desire to remain untouched by the world’s ancient wounds.**

### Geography & layout
Vaeltharyn is built around a natural basin where the Nullwood’s magic‑dampening effect is strongest. The city has no walls—the forest itself is the barrier.

**Key districts**
- **The Whispering Canopy** — elevated walkways and platforms in the upper branches; homes are grown from living wood.
- **The Stillwater Mirror** — a perfectly calm lake at the city’s center; elves believe it reflects the world “as it should be, not as it is.”
- **The Memory Courts** — quiet plazas for emotional and mnemonic rituals meant to maintain clarity and suppress dangerous memories.
- **The Veilwatch Spires** — slender towers where scouts monitor the horizon for magical disturbances; they log artifact activity but do not intervene.

### Culture & society
- Magic is subtle—illusions, emotional resonance, memory shaping.
- Voices are soft—loud speech is considered disrespectful.
- Architecture is grown, not built.
- History is curated—memories are pruned to avoid repeating ancient mistakes.

The city is led by the **Silent Regents**, elders who maintain Vaeltharyn’s emotional and magical equilibrium.

### Eclipse Day in Vaeltharyn
When the Eclipse struck, the Stillwater Mirror rippled for the first time in living memory. The forest hummed with a faint, discordant vibration.

The Regents have forbidden discussion of the visions that followed.

### How Vaeltharyn hints at the artifact mystery
- The city is built in a magically “quiet” zone.
- Elves avoid artifact sites with religious seriousness.
- Old myths describe “the world’s great noise.”
- Memory rituals hide more than they reveal.
