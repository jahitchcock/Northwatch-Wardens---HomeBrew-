# The Stonebound Dwarves (Draft — Off-map World Lore)

Status: draft. Not part of Northreach Season One canon unless explicitly adopted.

## Player version (safe / in-world)
Deep beneath the mountains lies the realm of the Stonebound Dwarves, a people who believe the world’s oldest truths are written in stone. Their halls are carved around massive crystalline formations and strange metallic structures they call “Deep Roots,” which they treat as natural features of the earth.

To the dwarves, these structures are not relics or ruins—they are part of the world’s foundation. Their geomancers and rune‑singers study vibrations of stone, believing the earth itself carries a song older than any mortal race.

The Stonebound Dwarves are known for:
- Resonant architecture and harmonic forges
- A blend of craftsmanship and deep‑earth magic
- A pragmatic, grounded worldview
- A fascination with the strange formations found deep underground

They do not fear the ancient structures they uncover. To them, such things are simply part of the world’s bedrock—mysterious, yes, but no more unnatural than a mountain or a river.

### Eclipse Day (player-facing)
The dwarves felt a deep tremor, as if the earth hummed a discordant note.

Most clans treat it as an omen whose meaning must be read in stone.

## DM version (truth / behind the curtain)
### The Stonebound Dwarves — witnesses to the deep roots
Dwarves have lived near dormant artifacts for so long that they consider them geological features. They discovered them underground, embedded in stone, and assumed they were natural formations.

Their magical tradition—runes, resonance, geomancy—developed from studying the subtle vibrations these artifacts emit even in dormancy.

**What the dwarves believe today:**
Artifacts are “Deep Roots,” part of the world’s skeleton.

**What actually happened:**
They built their civilization around dormant artifacts without realizing it.

**Why they don’t know the truth:**
The artifacts have been inert for thousands of years; their resonance is faint, stable, and easily misinterpreted as natural.

**How Eclipse Day affected them:**
The Heartstone—a massive artifact core—hummed for the first time in recorded history. Runes shifted. Stone vibrated. Deep‑Readers panicked.

They believe a new “verse” in the world’s song has begun. They do not understand that the artifacts are awakening.

## Khardûn‑Tharum, the Deep Crown (capital)
### Overview
Khardûn‑Tharum is a monumental underground city carved around a massive crystalline structure the dwarves call **the Heartstone**. To them, it is a natural wonder—a geological marvel that hums with faint resonance.

In truth, it is a dormant artifact core.

The dwarves do not know this. They have built their entire civilization around it.

### Geography & layout
The city spans multiple cavern levels shaped by centuries of geomancy and rune‑craft.

**Key districts**
- **The Heartstone Chamber** — a cathedral‑like cavern housing the core; treated as stable, eternal, and sacred.
- **The Resonant Forges** — workshops built around harmonic metal veins; forging produces subtle vibrational enchantments.
- **The Rune‑Singers’ Hall** — an amphitheater where magic is shaped through sound, vibration, and runic resonance.
- **The Deep‑Readers’ Archive** — geological records carved into stone tablets; tremors and vibrations are interpreted as messages.
- **The Lower Veins** — mining districts for rare metals and crystals that grow near the Heartstone.

### Culture & society
- Magic is physical—runes, vibrations, stone‑shaping.
- Craftsmanship is sacred.
- Stone is scripture.
- “Artifacts are geological”… or so they believe.

The city is governed by the **Stonebound Council**, drawn from master artisans, geomancers, and Deep‑Readers.

### Eclipse Day in Khardûn‑Tharum
When the Eclipse struck, the Heartstone hummed—loudly. Runes shifted. Crystals vibrated. Stone cracked in patterns unseen in recorded history.

The Deep‑Readers declared it a new “verse” in the world’s song.

### How Khardûn‑Tharum hints at the artifact mystery
- The Heartstone is a dormant artifact core.
- Dwarven magic is shaped by artifact resonance.
- Geological records may match awakening cycles.
- Their assumption that artifacts are “natural” blinds them to the truth.
