# Solaris (Draft — Off-map World Lore)

Status: draft. Not part of Northreach Season One canon unless explicitly adopted.

## Overview
Solaris is a vibrant metropolis known as the beating heart of music, storytelling, and bardic tradition. The city thrives on creativity, performance, and mythmaking; its plazas echo with tales and its streets feel like they are always mid‑song.

## The Tail Spinner’s Cord
At the center of Solaris’ artistic soul stands its most iconic tavern: **The Tail Spinner’s Cord**.

- A sprawling, warm, storied establishment where bards, musicians, and storytellers gather.
- Considered the birthplace of countless songs, legends, and epics.
- So influential that much of the city’s cultural identity radiates outward from it.
- Patrons claim stories told within its walls “gain a life of their own.”

It’s widely accepted that Solaris’ reputation as the world’s storytelling capital exists *because* of this tavern.

## Eldric the Loreweaver
Outside the Tail Spinner’s Cord stands a life‑sized statue of **Eldric the Loreweaver**, Solaris’ most revered bard.

### Who he was
- A legendary performer whose songs blended myth, history, and prophecy.
- Said to have soothed kings, stirred rebellions, and altered the course of fate.
- Some believe he foresaw the Eclipse Day centuries before it happened.

### Famous songs
| Title | Type | Reputation |
|---|---|---|
| The Ballad of the Guiding Stars | Epic travel ballad | Said to help travelers find their way in darkness. |
| Whispers of the Everwood | Mystical folk tune | A haunting melody tied to an enchanted forest. |
| The Promise of Evernight | Love ballad | Solaris’ most cherished romantic song. |
| The Rogue and the Barmaid’s Revelry | Cheeky tavern anthem | A rowdy, blush‑worthy sing‑along known worldwide. |

The statue depicts him mid‑performance, cloak swirling, lute raised—like the next note might still echo.

## Cultural identity
- **Music as a civic language** — disputes are settled with performances as often as with politics.
- **Storytelling as heritage** — many citizens know at least one Eldric tale by heart.
- **Tavern culture** — establishments like the Tail Spinner’s Cord serve as community hubs.
- **Pilgrimage of performers** — aspiring bards dream of playing the same stage Eldric once stood upon.

## The three factions of Solaris
### 1) The Luminary Concord
**Belief:** Order, structure, and divine law.

**Stance on warlocks:** Strictly opposed; pacts are seen as dangerous shortcuts that invite corruption.

**Influence:**
- Control many temples and civic institutions.
- Advocate for laws regulating magic, especially pact‑based magic.
- Push for a “pure” Solaris aligned with the gods of order and light.

### 2) The Veilbound Circle
**Belief:** Magic is a personal journey; pacts are tools, not sins.

**Stance on warlocks:** Supportive; pact magic is viewed as misunderstood and unfairly persecuted.

**Influence:**
- Protect warlocks and other marginalized casters.
- Operate schools and sanctuaries for unconventional magic.
- Promote tolerance, diplomacy, and magical freedom.

### 3) The Chorus of the Eclipse
**Belief:** Balance between light and shadow; power comes from embracing both.

**Stance on warlocks:** Neutral; pacts are one of many paths.

**Influence:**
- Emerged after Eclipse Day.
- Blend divine, arcane, and cosmic philosophies.
- Attract those who believe the world is entering a new era shaped by celestial forces.

## Eclipse Day
A cosmic event that changed everything.

### What happened
- A rare celestial alignment plunged Solaris into sudden darkness.
- Magic surged unpredictably; some spells failed, others became catastrophically powerful.
- Strange visions swept through the population.
- A rift briefly opened above the city, revealing a swirling tapestry of stars and shadow.

### Immediate aftermath
- Panic, awe, and religious upheaval.
- The Luminary Concord declared it a warning from the gods.
- The Veilbound Circle argued it proved magic is bigger than divine law.
- The Chorus of the Eclipse formed from those who felt it was a call to embrace cosmic balance.

## How Eclipse Day shapes the world today
- **Political tension:** factions compete to shape law, culture, and magical policy.
- **Cultural renaissance:** artists treat Eclipse Day as a symbol of transformation; Eldric’s works are reinterpreted through this lens.
- **Magical evolution:** new forms of magic and patrons proliferate; scholars study lingering anomalies.
- **Religious schisms:** divine and mortal institutions fracture over interpretation.
- **Global influence:** Solaris’ ideological struggle reshapes international politics and magical law.

## Solaris today
A city of music and myth, political intrigue, magical tension, cultural brilliance, and cosmic mystery—standing at the crossroads of tradition and transformation.
