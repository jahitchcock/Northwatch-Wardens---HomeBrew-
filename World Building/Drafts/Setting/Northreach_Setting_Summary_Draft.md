# Northreach — Setting Summary (Draft)

Status: draft summary pulled from scratchpad. Canonical player-facing lore primer remains in [../Northreach_Journal_and_Lore.md](../Northreach_Journal_and_Lore.md).

## Overview
Northreach is a cold, sparsely settled frontier region where wide roads and small settlements are stitched together by the persistence of hardy folk. The Waystone Inn serves as the practical center of travel, trade, and the headquarters of the Northwatch Wardens.

## The Northwatch Wardens
A contract-based guild that handles threats too dangerous or strange for local militias, with a code emphasizing protection of innocents, honoring contracts, sharing vital information, and respect for local people and traditions.

### Leadership (notes)
- Marshal Brenna Thorne — pragmatic field leader.
- Steward Mara Fenwick — logistics, supplies, pay.
- Lorewarden Elric Vael — records and arcane investigation.

## Campaign-scale threat (draft phrasing)
The region is affected by a growing arcane disturbance referred to here as the “Aeorian Echo”: unstable magic tied to ancient ruins and deeper mysteries.

## Notable NPCs (high-level note)
A diverse cast: Wardens, local leaders, cultists, awakened wolves, and scholars; many have secrets tied to the overarching mystery.
