# Welcome to Aevoria

*A World of Ancient Magic and Frontier Adventure*

---

Welcome, adventurer, to the world of Aevoria—a land where civilizations have risen and fallen, where ancient powers sleep beneath ice and stone, and where the frontier still holds secrets waiting to be discovered.

This guide will introduce you to the ten major regions of the known world, from the frozen wastes of the Far North to the volcanic fury of the Emberlands. Whether you seek fortune, knowledge, or simply a place to make your mark, Aevoria offers endless possibilities.

**Your story begins in Northreach** — a cold, dangerous frontier where survival depends on skill, preparation, and the bonds you forge with your fellow Wardens.

## Understanding This World

### What Makes Aevoria Unique

**A World in Transition**  
The old certainties are changing. Magic that once seemed predictable now behaves strangely. Ancient ruins stir after millennia of silence. Animals act with uncanny awareness. Across the world, from scholars in southern cities to druids in wild forests, people sense that something fundamental is shifting—though no one yet understands what or why.

**Ten Distinct Regions**  
Aevoria is not one unified empire but a tapestry of cultures, each adapted to their land: dwarves who listen to stone's resonance beneath mountains, elves who preserve memory in silent forests, humans who build kingdoms on art and politics, and those who thrive in lawless cities or volcanic wastelands. Each region has its own character, dangers, and opportunities.

**Magic is Rare but Real**  
Spellcasters are uncommon, especially on the frontier. A village might have one hedge witch or traveling cleric. Cities boast colleges and temples, but even there, true magic is respected and sometimes feared. Divine magic flows from the gods, while arcane power comes from study, bloodlines, or pacts. Both are tools—dangerous in the wrong hands, invaluable in the right ones.

**The Frontier Calls**  
The civilized heartlands—Solaris, the Stonebound Depths, Vaeltharyn—are places of law, tradition, and relative safety. But the frontier (Northreach, the Emberlands, the Shattered Coast) offers what cities cannot: freedom from ancient hierarchies, unclaimed treasures, and the chance to make your own legend. The frontier doesn't care about your past; it only cares if you're strong enough, smart enough, and lucky enough to survive.

## The Ten Regions at a Glance

### 1. Northreach — The Frozen Frontier

**Where Your Adventure Begins**

- **Character:** Cold, isolated, dangerous
- **Who Lives Here:** Hardy settlers, Northwatch Wardens, isolated homesteaders
- **What It Offers:** Freedom, opportunity, and deadly challenges

Northreach is a sparsely settled frontier where winter lasts most of the year and communities survive through mutual aid and sheer stubbornness. The Northwatch Wardens—your guild—operate from the Waystone Inn, taking contracts to protect settlements from threats both mundane and supernatural.

Recent reports speak of wolves acting with unnatural intelligence, strange lights in the northern sky, and ancient ruins emerging from melting ice. Most people dismiss such tales as frontier superstition. The Wardens know better.

**Why Start Here:** Northreach represents the classic adventuring frontier—lawless, dangerous, and full of opportunity for those brave (or desperate) enough to seek it.

### 2. Solaris Dominion — The Cultural Heart

- **Character:** Vibrant, politically complex, artistically rich
- **Who Lives Here:** Bards, politicians, artists, merchants, courtiers
- **What It Offers:** Culture, intrigue, social climbing, bardic colleges

Far to the south, Solaris is everything Northreach is not: warm, wealthy, and civilized. The city thrives on music, storytelling, and political maneuvering. Three major factions compete for the city's soul, each offering a different vision of power and progress.

News from the frontier travels to Solaris quickly, transformed into songs and stories. What you do in Northreach may become legend in Solaris—though the details will likely be embellished.

**Adventure Hooks:** Political intrigue, bardic competitions, factional conflicts, investigation of arcane secrets

---

### 3. The Nullwood Expanse — The Silent Forest

- **Character:** Eerily quiet, memory-focused, deeply mysterious
- **Who Lives Here:** Elves of the Silent Court, rangers, hermits
- **What It Offers:** Ancient lore, magical silence, preserved histories

The Nullwood is an elven kingdom unlike any other: the forest itself absorbs sound, creating an environment of whispers and gestures. The elves here are guardians of memory, maintaining vast archives of the past and fiercely resisting rapid change.

They view recent "awakenings" in the world with deep unease, though they struggle to explain why these events feel so disturbingly familiar.

**Adventure Hooks:** Diplomatic missions, memory recovery, ancient secrets, forest guardianship

### 4. The Stonebound Depths — The Dwarven Kingdom

- **Character:** Ancient, traditional, resonant with earth-magic
- **Who Lives Here:** Dwarven clans, master craftsmen, geomancers
- **What It Offers:** Unmatched craftsmanship, deep-earth lore, geological mysteries

Beneath southern mountains, the dwarves have carved a civilization into living stone. They practice resonance—a form of geomancy that lets them "listen" to the earth. Recently, their sacred Heartstone hummed for the first time in recorded history, a sign the dwarves interpret as the beginning of a new "verse" in the world's song.

Dwarven goods—weapons, armor, tools—are the finest in the world, but they rarely leave the Depths except through trusted trade partners.

**Adventure Hooks:** Crafting quests, deep cavern exploration, ancient dwarven ruins, geological mysteries

---

### 5. Vharoxis — The City of Masks

- **Character:** Lawless, opportunistic, deeply pragmatic
- **Who Lives Here:** Criminals, smugglers, exiles, merchants, anyone seeking anonymity
- **What It Offers:** Black-market goods, forbidden knowledge, second chances

In Vharoxis, everyone wears a mask—literally. Identity is fluid, law is what you can enforce, and "what you can keep is yours." The city operates on reputation, contracts, and careful negotiation. Betray your word, and you'll never do business again. Keep it, and even the most questionable deals are honored.

Strange artifacts from the north fetch high prices in Vharoxis markets. Some Wardens have... complicated histories here.

**Adventure Hooks:** Smuggling, heists, information trading, moral ambiguity, artifact recovery

---

### 6. The Shattered Coast — The Maritime Frontier

- **Character:** Treacherous waters, shipwrecks, coastal dangers
- **Who Lives Here:** Sailors, pirates, salvage crews, coastal settlers
- **What It Offers:** Maritime adventure, sunken treasure, storm magic

The western coast is a graveyard of ships, where jagged reefs and unpredictable storms claim vessels regularly. Despite the danger, it's the primary trade route between north and south. Pirates, salvagers, and legitimate merchants compete for dominance.

Recently, strange things have been washing ashore: glowing stones, humming metal fragments, creatures that behave wrongly.

**Adventure Hooks:** Naval combat, shi pwreck salvage, pirate conflicts, storm investigations

### 7. The Emberlands — The Volcanic South

- **Character:** Harsh, resilient, shaped by recent catastrophe
- **Who Lives Here:** Survivors, the Red Covenant (disaster relief), desperate refugees
- **What It Offers:** Extreme survival challenges, volcanic materials, redemption arcs

Within living memory, a magical cataclysm tore the Emberlands apart. Volcanoes rage, the earth splits open, and fire magic runs wild. Despite this, people endure—they have nowhere else to go. The Red Covenant disaster relief organization provides what help it can, but survival ultimately depends on improvisation and determination.

The Emberlands share something with Northreach: both regions experienced dramatic, unexplainable events. Some scholars are beginning to compare notes.

**Adventure Hooks:** Disaster relief, volcanic hazards, refugee protection, investigating the cataclysm's cause

### 8. The Verdant Marches — The Wild Green

- **Character:** Lush, primal, alive with natural magic
- **Who Lives Here:** Druids, rangers, farming communities, wild beasts
- **What It Offers:** Druidic mysteries, natural magic, agricultural bounty

The Marches are Aevoria's breadbasket—fertile farmland bounded by ancient forests where druids maintain the balance between civilization and wilderness. Recently, druids report the "Green Stirring": plants growing unnaturally fast, animals coordinating in impossible ways, the sense that nature itself is waking up.

These reports sound disturbingly similar to stories from Northreach. Information flows between northern Wardens and southern druids through ranger networks.

**Adventure Hooks:** Druidic rituals, beast investigations, protecting harvests, exploring the Green Stirring

---

### 9. The Sunken Dominion — The Underwater Realm

- **Character:** Alien, mysterious, barely understood by surface dwellers
- **Who Lives Here:** Merfolk, tritons, sea elves, deep-sea creatures
- **What It Offers:** Underwater adventure, drowned ruins, coral architecture

Beneath the waves, aquatic peoples maintain their own civilization, largely independent of surface politics. Coastal settlements with mixed populations serve as meeting points, but the deep ocean remains mysterious even to seasoned sailors.

The Dominion is "awakening" in its own way—ancient structures are rising, and sea-dwellers speak of "something old" stirring in the depths.

**Adventure Hooks:** Underwater exploration, diplomatic missions, maritime mysteries, drowned city investigations

### 10. The Far North — The Frozen Wastes

- **Character:** Deadly cold, ancient mysteries, cosmic dread
- **Who Lives Here:** Nomadic herders, desperate scavengers, researchers
- **What It Offers:** Extreme survival, ancient ruins, forbidden knowledge

North of Palebank Village lies a frozen wasteland where blizzards rage endlessly and the ice stretches to the horizon. Few travel there by choice. Those who do seek one thing: the ruins of an ancient civilization buried beneath millennia of ice.

Fragments of metal towers, strange formations, sealed entrances—the ruins are scattered across the North, their purpose unknown and their contents deadly. Recent reports speak of ruins "waking up," ice melting in unnatural patterns, and lights moving beneath frozen surfaces.

The Northwatch Wardens are beginning to suspect that events in the frontier may be connected to something in the Far North. Understanding what lies beneath the ice might be the key to protecting the settlements.

**Adventure Hooks:** Ruin exploration, survival challenges, artifact recovery, investigating the source of frontier strangeness

## How the Regions Connect

While each region has its own character, they're not isolated. Trade routes, diplomatic relationships, and simple human curiosity connect the world:

**Trade and Information**  
News travels fastest along trade routes. What happens in Northreach reaches Solaris through Shattered Coast shipping lanes, then spreads to Vharoxis (as opportunity) and the Verdant Marches (as concern). Information flows, though it's often distorted by distance and retelling.

**Cultural Exchange**  
Dwarven crafts, elven archives, Solaran art, and Vharoxis contraband flow between regions. Adventurers, merchants, pilgrims, and refugees carry not just goods but ideas, blending cultures at every crossroads.

**Shared Mysteries**  
Scholars across Aevoria are beginning to notice patterns: unexplained magical phenomena in multiple regions, ancient ruins becoming active, animals and plants behaving strangely. No one has connected all the pieces yet, but the pattern is there for those who look.

**Your Role**  
As a Northwatch Warden, you operate primarily in the frontier. But the contracts you take may lead you elsewhere: escorting a scholar to the Stonebound Depths, tracking smugglers to Vharoxis, or investigating rumors that connect northern events to southern mysteries. The world is vast, but adventurers have a way of finding themselves wherever the action is.
