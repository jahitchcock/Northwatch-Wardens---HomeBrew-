## How These Regions Connect

### The Aeorian Echo Mystery
All regions experience effects from the reawakening of ancient Aeorian artifacts:
- **Northreach:** Direct exposure; awakening intelligence, destabilization
- **Solaris:** Social and political upheaval; Eclipse Day
- **Nullwood:** Ancient fears resurface; magical silence cracks
- **Stonebound:** Dormant cores begin humming; stone records shift
- **Vharoxis:** Power vacuum and opportunistic exploitation
- **Shattered Coast:** Artifact fragments surface from the sea
- **Emberlands:** Volcanic resonance and violent manifestations
- **Verdant Marches:** Beast awakening on continental scale
- **Sunken Dominion:** Underwater nodes reactivate
- **Far North:** Source of the Echo; fastest awakening

- **Trade goods:** Items and artifacts flow through Northreach
- **Faction agents:** Representatives from other regions appear in Northreach

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Northreach First:** All expansion serves the core campaign
2. **Mystery Layers:** Each region provides partial truths about the Echo
3. **Thematic Unity:** All regions reflect different responses to ancient magic
4. **Cultural Depth:** Each region has distinct identity and internal conflicts
5. **Scalability:** Content works for multiple campaign levels and scopes

### Tone Consistency
- **Grounded fantasy:** Magic is rare and dangerous
- **Historical weight:** Ancient consequences shape present conflicts
- **Frontier mentality:** Survival and community matter everywhere
- **Investigation focus:** Discovery drives narrative progression
- **Moral complexity:** No simple good/evil divisions
