# Northreach — The Frontier Region

**Theme:** Frontier survival, awakening magic, Aeorian Echo  
**Tone:** Gritty, isolated, dangerous  
**Role in the World:** The epicenter of the Aeorian Echo and the Wardens' home territory

---

## Overview

Northreach is a cold, sparsely settled frontier region where the ancient past is quite literally breaking through into the present. Most inhabitants know only local concerns—wolves, bandits, missing hunters—but beneath the surface, an ancient disturbance known as the **Aeorian Echo** is spreading outward from buried ruins, awakening magic and destabilizing reality in subtle, deniable ways.

This is the heart of the Northwatch Wardens campaign. Everything else in the Known World connects back to what happens here.

## The Aeorian Echo

### What It Is
A spreading wave of arcane disturbance emanating from Salsvault and other buried Aeorian facilities. Ancient magic awakening after millennia of dormancy, leaking outward through stone and earth, affecting everything it touches.

### Observable Effects
- **Intelligence awakening** in animals (Welton wolves)
- **Magical corruption** causing disease (Frigid Woe in Palebank)
- **Reality destabilization** causing unpredictable magic (Noke's wand)
- **Construct activation** in ancient sites (Salsvault defenders)
- **Faction mobilization** as powers sense opportunity (Dragonknights)

### Progression Pattern
The Echo spreads in concentric rings from Salsvault, with intensity decreasing by distance but effects growing more complex:

1. **Immediate proximity (Salsvault):** Raw, violent, destructive
2. **Near reach (Palebank):** Direct corruption, illness, environmental damage
3. **Mid-range (Welton, Pinebrook):** Intelligence awakening, social disruption
4. **Far reach (Temple area):** Faction awareness, magical amplification
5. **Frontier edge:** Subtle changes, dismissed as coincidence

### Mystery Structure
The Aeorian Echo operates as the campaign's central mystery, with revelations designed to work in any order:

**Early clues:**
- Strange animal behavior
- Unexplained illness
- Magic malfunctioning
- Ancient sites becoming active

**Mid-campaign revelations:**
- Aeorian origin discovered
- Pattern of spreading effects recognized
- Multiple sites identified
- Faction involvement exposed


**Late-campaign understanding:**
- Full scope of Echo revealed
- Source location confirmed (Salsvault)
- Nature of awakening understood
- Endgame confrontation prepared

### Player Discovery Paths
No matter which adventures players complete first, they accumulate pieces of the puzzle:

- **Wolves of Welton:** Intelligence awakening (symptom)
- **Frozen Sick:** Aeorian spores and active ruins (source)
- **Temple of Dragonknights:** Faction exploitation (consequence)
- **Wild Sheep Chase:** Magic destabilizing (symptom)
- **Peril in Pinebrook:** Community vulnerability (impact)
