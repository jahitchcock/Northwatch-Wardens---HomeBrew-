## Northreach in One Paragraph

Northreach is a cold, sparsely settled frontier. **Waystone Inn** sits at the practical center of travel and trade: a safe hearth between small communities, logging roads, and old ruins. Most people here know only local problems; wolves, bandits, missing hunters, and weather.

## Hub-and-Spokes Map 

Use this mental map when you think of Northreach.


- **Waystone Inn** (center): Warden HQ; where contracts begin/end.
- **Welton** (southwest): farming village; 
  - **Westly’s Farm:** west of Welton;
  - **Shepherd’s Crook Inn:** Welton’s social and rumor engine.
- **Pinebrook** (southeast)
- **Noke’s Tower** (near Waystone, upriver)
- **Temple of the Dragonknights** (northwest mountains)
- **Palebank Village (northeast coast):** coastal settlement

## Travel

- Waystone Inn ↔ Welton: **1–2 days**
- Waystone Inn ↔ Pinebrook: **2–3 days**
- Waystone Inn ↔ Noke’s Tower: **½–1 day** (quick side trek)
- Waystone Inn ↔ Palebank: **3–5 days** (weather can stretch this)



## The People

- **Low-magic daily life, high-magic consequences.** The weird stuff is rare, but when it happens it’s dangerous.
- **Frontier politics matter.** Votes, favors, and grudges have weight (Welton council, Palebank leaders).
