## Northreach in One Paragraph

Northreach is a cold, sparsely settled frontier where survival depends on community, preparation, and the protection provided by organizations like the Northwatch Wardens. **Waystone Inn** sits at the practical center of travel and trade—a safe hearth between small settlements, logging roads, and old ruins. Most people here concern themselves with local problems: wolves, bandits, missing hunters, and weather. But recently, strange reports have been filtering in from across the region, making even seasoned frontiersmen uneasy.

## Common Knowledge

*Everyone in Northreach knows these facts. Your character would be familiar with all of this information.*

### Geography and Settlement

**The Hub-and-Spokes:** Northreach is organized around Waystone Inn, with small settlements scattered like spokes on a wheel:

- **Waystone Inn** (center) — Northwatch Warden headquarters; neutral ground; safest place between settlements
- **Welton** (southwest) — Farming village of ~200 people; governed by elected council
- **Pinebrook** (southeast) — Trading post and lumber camp; smaller than Welton
- **Palebank Village** (northeast coast) — Fishing settlement; gateway to the Far North
- **Noke's Tower** (west of Waystone) — Wizard's tower; local eccentric
- **Temple of the Dragonknights** (northwest mountains) — Monastery; keeps to itself

**Travel Times from Waystone Inn:**
- Welton: 1–2 days on foot
- Pinebrook: 2–3 days on foot  
- Noke's Tower: Half-day to 1 day (easy trek)
- Palebank Village: 3–5 days (weather dependent)
- Temple of the Dragonknights: 4–6 days (mountain roads)

### Climate and Seasons

**Winter Dominates:** Northreach has three seasons:

- **Long Winter** (8 months): Snow, ice, temperatures well below freezing. Travel is dangerous without preparation.
- **Mud Season** (2 months): Spring thaw turns roads to muck. Almost worse than winter for travel.
- **Short Summer** (2 months): Brief warm period. Everyone rushes to complete outdoor work before winter returns.

**Survival Basics:**
- Always carry cold-weather gear outside settlements
- Never travel alone in winter
- Stock supplies before winter; resupply may be impossible for months
- Learn to read weather signs or hire someone who can

### The Northwatch Wardens

The Wardens are Northreach's frontier protection guild, operating from Waystone Inn. When communities face threats beyond their capability—awakened wolves, bandits, strange magical events—they post contracts for the Wardens to handle.

**Leadership:** Marshal Brenna Thorne (field operations), Steward Mara Fenwick (logistics and supplies), Lorewarden Elric Vael (research and arcane threats).

**→ For the complete charter, guild code, roster, and membership details, see Chapter 4: The Northwatch Wardens.**

### Money and Trade

**Currency:**
- Coins are accepted but relatively rare on the frontier
- Most transactions involve barter: labor, goods, future favors
- A day's skilled work = 2 gp equivalent in value
- A day's heavy labor = 5 sp equivalent in value

**What's Available:**
- Basic supplies (food, rope, common tools): readily available
- Quality weapons and armor: rare; usually imported or custom-made
- Spell components: very limited selection; exotic components require trips to cities
- Healing potions and magic items: extremely rare; often family heirlooms

**Where to Shop:**
- Waystone Inn: basic adventuring supplies, some weapons/armor
- Welton: food, farming tools, basic goods
- Pinebrook: lumber, trapping supplies, furs
- Palebank: fishing gear, cold-weather equipment, seal-oil lamps

### Magic and the Strange

**Low-Magic Society:**

Most people in Northreach go their entire lives without seeing magic. When it does appear, reactions vary:

- **Clerics and paladins** — Generally trusted; divine magic is seen as gods' will
- **Wizards and sorcerers** — Viewed with caution; arcane magic is powerful but unpredictable
- **Warlocks** — Distrusted; pact magic implies dangerous bargains
- **Druids and rangers** — Respected; nature magic is understood as part of the land
- **Bards** — Welcome; entertainment is rare and valued

**Rules of Frontier Magic:**
1. Don't cast flashy spells in settlements without warning people first
2. Don't use magic to cheat, steal, or intimidate
3. If your magic hurts someone or breaks something, you pay restitution
4. If locals ask you not to cast magic in their home/shop, respect it

**Recent Strangeness:**

Over the past few months, people across Northreach have reported unusual events:
- Animals behaving with uncanny awareness or coordination
- Objects moving on their own or responding to emotions
- Dreams shared among entire villages
- Colors, sounds, or sensations that "shouldn't exist"
- Plants growing in impossible patterns or seasons

No one knows what's causing it. The Northwatch Wardens are investigating.

## What You've Heard

*Rumors, gossip, and stories circulating around Northreach. Your character might have heard some or all of these. They may or may not be true.*

### About Settlements

**Welton:**
- "The village council is arguing again about whether to hire more guards or trust the Wardens."
- "Westly the shepherd lost half his flock to wolves last month. He swears the wolves opened the gate themselves."
- "Someone—or something—has been leaving strange symbols carved into trees around Westly's Farm."
- "The Shepherd's Crook Inn serves the best mutton stew in Northreach. Arrive early or it sells out."

**Pinebrook:**
- "Lumber crews are refusing to work certain sections of forest. They say the trees whisper to each other."
- "The trading post had a break-in, but nothing was stolen. Just... rearranged. Like someone was searching for something specific."
- "There's good money in logging, but the work destroys your back and the pay barely covers winter supplies."

**Palebank:**
- "Fishermen pulled up something from the deep last week. Metal, covered in ice, with strange markings. They threw it back."

### About Notable Figures

**Marshal Brenna Thorne (Northwatch Wardens):**
- "She's former military—maybe imperial, maybe something else. She doesn't talk about it."
- "Fair but tough. She'll give you a chance, but only one. Screw up and you're out."
- "I heard she turned down a command position in Solaris to stay on the frontier. Wonder why?"

**Steward Mara Fenwick (Northwatch Wardens):**
- "She knows the value of everything within a copper piece. Can't cheat her."
- "Surprisingly good fighter for a quartermaster. Don't let the ledgers fool you."
- "She's been at Waystone longer than anyone. If you want to know frontier history, ask Mara."

**Lorewarden Elric Vael (Northwatch Wardens):**
- "He spends more time in his library than with people. Bit odd, but brilliant."
- "I heard he used to teach at a magical college down south before coming here. No one knows why he left."
- "If it's weird, magical, or ancient, Elric probably has a book about it. Or he'll write one."

**Noke the Finicky (Wizard, Noke's Tower):**
- "Eccentric doesn't begin to describe him. Last month he tried to polymorph himself into a sheep to 'understand their perspective.' It went badly."
- "Don't accept random magical items from him. Half of them are cursed or backfire spectacularly."
- "Despite everything, he's actually quite skilled. Just... unpredictable."

### About Dangers

**Wolves:**
- "They're not acting like normal wolves. Too smart. Too organized."
- "Some say a sorcerer is controlling them. Others claim they're awakening on their own."
- "Whatever the cause, they're more dangerous than usual. Don't travel alone."

**Bandits:**
- "There's a group operating out of Croaker Cave, north of Palebank. They hit supply wagons."
- "Most bandits are just desperate people trying to survive. Some are worse."

**The Wild Places:**
- "The old ruins scattered across Northreach? They're waking up. Lights in windows that haven't had glass in centuries."
- "Rangers say the forests feel... aware. Like they're being watched by something old and patient."
- "There are caves in the northern mountains that no one explores twice. The first group comes back shaken. The second doesn't come back at all."

### Local Customs and Etiquette

**Frontier Hospitality:**
- Offering food and shelter to travelers is expected
- Refusing hospitality without good reason is an insult
- Guests are expected to contribute (chores, stories, information, small payment)
- Overstaying your welcome: 2-3 nights is standard; longer requires explicit invitation

**Survival Culture:**
- Wasting resources (food, firewood, supplies) is considered shameful
- Hoarding during hard times while others starve is remembered forever
- "Winter debt": owing someone aid you can't repay until spring is acceptable; refusing to help because they can't pay immediately is not

**Social Hierarchy:**
- Frontier culture is relatively egalitarian
- Respect is earned through competence and reliability, not birth or title
- Elders and those with specialized knowledge (healers, trackers, etc.) are valued
- Empty boasts or exaggerated credentials are quickly exposed and mocked

**Magic:**
- In settlements, ask before casting
- Demonstrating useful magic (light, mending, etc.) builds goodwill
- Using magic to intimidate or show off creates distrust
- If your magic causes problems, you fix it—no excuses

**The Wardens:**
- "Guild business is guild business"—don't ask Wardens to discuss active contracts
- Wardens are expected to be neutral in local disputes unless hired
- Offering to buy a Warden a drink is standard friendliness
- Trying to bribe a Warden on contract is a good way to make enemies

### Seasonal Considerations

**Winter (Most of the Year):**
- Plan for being snowed in; always have 2 weeks of supplies
- Cold damage is a real threat—track exposure carefully
- Travel may be impossible during storms (1d4 days)
- Some contracts can't be completed until spring—communicate honestly with clients

**Mud Season:**
- Roads become impassable bogs
- Travel takes 50% longer
- Wheel-based vehicles are useless; use sleds or pack animals
- Disease spreads more easily—freshwater and hygiene are priorities

**Summer:**
- Everyone works frantically to prepare for winter
- Harvest-time work is plentiful but exhausting
- Best time for long-distance travel or ruin exploration
- Prices for preserved goods rise as winter approaches

## The Mysteries of Northreach

*Your character might wonder about these things. Investigating them could lead to adventures.*

### The Recent Strangeness

Something is changing in Northreach. The signs are subtle but accumulating:

- **Wildlife Behavior:** Animals coordinating in ways that seem impossible. Pack hunters developing strategies that shouldn't occur naturally.
- **Ruins Activating:** Ancient structures showing signs of life—lights, sounds, warmth—after centuries of dormancy.
- **Shared Experiences:** Multiple people reporting identical dreams or sensations with no obvious connection.
- **Objects Awakening:** Tools, weapons, or other items responding to emotions or intentions.

**Questions No One Can Answer:**
- Is this happening elsewhere, or just in Northreach?
- Is it connected to the ruins scattered across the region?
- Why now, after so long?
- Is it dangerous, or just strange?

The Northwatch Wardens are actively investigating, but they're being careful not to cause panic. Most locals dismiss individual incidents as coincidence or exaggeration. Those who've seen multiple events know better.

### The Far North

North of Palebank, the frozen wastes stretch toward the top of the world. Buried beneath the ice are ruins—towers of metal, chambers sealed for millennia, artifacts of a civilization lost to time.

Most people avoid the ruins. Those who explore them report:
- Strange technology that doesn't run on magic
- Sealed vaults that resist all attempts to open them
- A pervasive sense of unease, like being watched
- Occasionally: treasures, knowledge, or items of power

Lately, the rumors have grown darker:
- Ice melting around certain ruins, exposing entrances
- Lights moving beneath frozen surfaces
- People venturing north and not returning

**The Question:** Is the strangeness in Northreach somehow connected to whatever lies beneath the northern ice?

##### For Curious Minds

The world is larger and stranger than these few pages can capture. Northreach is your starting point, but it's not your boundary. As you gain experience and reputation, contracts may take you far from the Waystone Inn—to southern cities, ancient forests, or deeper mysteries than you can currently imagine.

The frontier rewards the bold, the clever, and the prepared. But it punishes the reckless.

*Stay sharp. Trust your companions. Question everything.*
