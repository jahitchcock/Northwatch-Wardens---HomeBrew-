# Cultures of Northreach


## Overview

Northreach isn't defined by a single culture but by the practical blending of peoples who've chosen—or been forced—to live on the frontier. What emerges is a culture of survival, mutual aid, and earned respect, where your past matters less than what you contribute now.

## The Frontier Culture

### Shared Values

#### Practical Competence
Actions matter more than words:
- Can you do the work you claim to do?
- Do you maintain your tools and property?
- Can you handle problems without constant help?
- Do you admit when you're out of your depth?

#### Keeping Your Word
Promises are binding:
- Contracts are sacred (written or spoken)
- Breaking an oath marks you as untrustworthy
- Debts are remembered for years
- Your reputation follows you everywhere

#### Mutual Aid
Survival depends on cooperation:
- Help your neighbors during emergencies
- Contribute to community efforts
- Share warnings about danger
- Defend the community when threatened

#### Self-Reliance
Independence is respected but has limits:
- Handle your own problems when possible
- Don't be a burden to others
- Know when to ask for help
- Don't mistake pride for strength

#### Respect for the Land
Nature commands respect:
- The wilderness is dangerous and should be treated as such
- Don't waste resources (especially during winter)
- Learn to read weather, tracks, and seasons
- Listen to those with more experience
