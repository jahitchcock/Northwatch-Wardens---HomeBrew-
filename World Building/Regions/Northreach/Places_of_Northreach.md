# Places of Northreach


## Overview

Northreach reveals itself mile by mile: wind-combed forests, narrow roads that widen and contract like breathing, and settlements that feel earned against the cold expanse. This is a region where distance matters, where the space between warm lights can swallow the unwary, and where every community represents a deliberate choice to endure.

- **Main Hall:** Two-story structure with a common room, kitchen, and guest quarters
- **Warden's Wing:** Added fifteen years ago, includes meeting rooms, armory, and private quarters
