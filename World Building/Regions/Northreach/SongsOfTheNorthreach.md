# THE FRONTIER BREATHES

### LANTERNS AT THE WAYSTONE  

#### Verse 1
There’s a lantern at the Waystone Inn
That never seems to fade.
Through winter storms and drifting snows,
Its golden light is laid.
Travelers say the hearth burns warm
No matter how winds roar—
And the road feels shorter somehow
When you’re walking toward its door.

#### Chorus
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Shining through the night.
Guiding weary footsteps
By their gentle, steady light.
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Soft against the cold—
A quiet place on a long, long road,
Where stories rest untold.

#### Verse 2
Some swear the air grows calmer there,
As if the world exhales.
Others say the shadows fall
In strangely peaceful trails.
But no one speaks of omens,
And no one asks for signs—
They simply take their comfort
In the warmth the inn provides.

#### Chorus
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Shining through the night.
Guiding weary footsteps
By their gentle, steady light.
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Soft against the cold—
A quiet place on a long, long road,
Where stories rest untold.

#### Bridge
Maybe it’s the timber,
Maybe it’s the stone—
Maybe it’s the feeling
Of never being quite alone.

#### Final Chorus
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Shining through the night.
Guiding weary footsteps
By their gentle, steady light.
Lanterns at the Waystone,
Soft against the cold—
A quiet place on a long, long road,
Where stories rest untold.

### THE HUNTER WHO RETURNED ALONE  

#### Verse 1
They say the snows were higher then,
The winds a sharper blade.
The hunters marched at winter’s call
Through shadowed, frozen glade.
But only one came walking back,
Her bowstring stiff with frost—
And no one asked what met them there,
Or what the others lost.

#### Chorus
Oh the winter keeps its secrets,
And the pines, they never tell.
Some roads lead home in silence,
Some wanderings end in hell.
But the Hunter who returned alone
Still walks the northern stone—
And the wind that follows at her heels
Is colder than the bone.

#### Verse 2
She never speaks of what she saw,
Nor names the ones she led.
But when the moon is thin and pale,
Her eyes turn toward the dead.
The Wardens know her steady hand,
Her voice that does not shake—
But none can read the quiet grief
That winter will not break.

#### Chorus
Oh the winter keeps its secrets,
And the pines, they never tell.
Some roads lead home in silence,
Some wanderings end in hell.
But the Hunter who returned alone
Still walks the northern stone—
And the wind that follows at her heels
Is colder than the bone.

#### Bridge
Some say the storm remembers,
Some say the night does too—
But she just keeps on walking,
As all true hunters do.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the winter keeps its secrets,
And the pines, they never tell.
Some roads lead home in silence,
Some wanderings end in hell.
But the Hunter who returned alone
Still walks the northern stone—
And the wind that follows at her heels
Is colder than the bone.

### THE WOMAN WITH TWO SHADOWS  

#### Verse 1
There’s a tale they tell in market towns
Of a woman quick and bright—
Who walks as if she listens
To footsteps out of sight.
They say she keeps her ledger clean,
Her smile warm and wide—
But some swear when the lanterns dim,
A second shadow walks beside.

#### Chorus
Oh the woman with two shadows,
She moves like shifting sand.
One rooted in the daylight,
One reaching for her hand.
No one knows her story,
No one speaks her name—
But the woman with two shadows
Walks faster than her shame.

#### Verse 2
She bargains fair with merchants,
She laughs with honest folk—
But travelers whisper softly
Of debts that never spoke.
And though she keeps her head down low,
Her eyes still scan the door—
As if she fears a knocking
From a life she knew before.

#### Chorus
Oh the woman with two shadows,
She moves like shifting sand.
One rooted in the daylight,
One reaching for her hand.
No one knows her story,
No one speaks her name—
But the woman with two shadows
Walks faster than her shame.

#### Bridge
Some say she fled the winter,
Some say she fled the knife—
But all agree her shadows
Have followed all her life.


#### Final Chorus
Oh the woman with two shadows,
She moves like shifting sand.
One rooted in the daylight,
One reaching for her hand.
No one knows her story,
No one speaks her name—
But the woman with two shadows
Walks faster than her shame.

### THE SLEEPLESS SCHOLAR  

#### Verse 1
There’s a candle in the tower
That burns through every night.
A scholar keeps his vigil there
By thin and silver light.
He writes of winds that wander wrong,
Of stars that shift their place—
And though he speaks in gentle tones,
There’s worry in his face.

#### Chorus
Oh the sleepless scholar watches
While the northern shadows grow.
He listens to the quiet
For things he cannot show.
And though his words are measured,
And though his smile is mild—
The sleepless scholar knows too much
To ever sleep like a child.

#### Verse 2
Some say he dreams with open eyes,
Of frost beneath the stone—
Of something stirring far away
In places long unknown.
He never speaks of visions,
He never names the signs—
But he keeps his quill at ready
When the winter moon declines.

#### Chorus
Oh the sleepless scholar watches
While the northern shadows grow.
He listens to the quiet
For things he cannot show.
And though his words are measured,
And though his smile is mild—
The sleepless scholar knows too much
To ever sleep like a child.

#### Bridge
The Wardens trust his wisdom,
Though they do not know its cost—
For every night he studies
Is another morning lost.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the sleepless scholar watches
While the northern shadows grow.
He listens to the quiet
For things he cannot show.
And though his words are measured,
And though his smile is mild—
The sleepless scholar knows too much
To ever sleep like a child.

### THE SHEPHERD WHO HEARD THE HILLS SPEAK  

#### Verse 1
They say he walks the Welton fields
Before the break of day,
Listening to the quiet earth
In his own peculiar way.
He knows the paths the rivers take,
The turns the foxes choose—
And he can read the winter wind
Like others read the news.

#### Chorus
Oh the hills speak softly
To the ones who walk alone.
Their whispers ride the morning frost,
Their secrets carved in stone.
And though he never tells them,
And though he never seeks—
The shepherd of the Welton fields
Once heard the hillside speak.

#### Verse 2
Some claim he knows the wolves by name,
And they know him in kind.
He walks the borders unafraid
With steady heart and mind.
But when the moon is hanging low
And shadows stretch and creep—
He pauses, as if listening
To something in the deep.

#### Chorus
Oh the hills speak softly
To the ones who walk alone.
Their whispers ride the morning frost,
Their secrets carved in stone.
And though he never tells them,
And though he never seeks—
The shepherd of the Welton fields
Once heard the hillside speak.

#### Bridge
A dream can be a warning,
A dream can be a guide—
But some dreams stay unspoken,
Kept quietly inside.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the hills speak softly
To the ones who walk alone.
Their whispers ride the morning frost,
Their secrets carved in stone.
And though he never tells them,
And though he never seeks—
The shepherd of the Welton fields
Once heard the hillside speak.

### TRACKS IN THE SNOW THAT NEVER FADE  

#### Verse 1
There’s a tale the rangers whisper
When the winter nights grow long—
Of a man who walks the northern trails
With silence in his song.
They say he knows the forest well,
Each ridge and frozen glade—
But he avoids a certain hollow
Where old tracks never fade.

#### Chorus
Oh the snow remembers footsteps,
And the wind recalls the cries.
Some paths are marked by shadows,
Some truths by silent eyes.
And though he walks with steady stride,
His heart is heavy‑laid—
For he has seen the kind of tracks
That never truly fade.

#### Verse 2
He keeps his stories close at hand,
His memories even closer.
He speaks of wolves with reverence,
Of winter growing colder.
But when the fire burns low at night,
And talk begins to stray—
He stares into the embers
As if they pull him far away.

#### Chorus
Oh the snow remembers footsteps,
And the wind recalls the cries.
Some paths are marked by shadows,
Some truths by silent eyes.
And though he walks with steady stride,
His heart is heavy‑laid—
For he has seen the kind of tracks
That never truly fade.

#### Bridge
Some say he guards a secret,
Some say he guards a friend—
But all agree the northern trails
Will follow him to end.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the snow remembers footsteps,
And the wind recalls the cries.
Some paths are marked by shadows,
Some truths by silent eyes.
And though he walks with steady stride,
His heart is heavy‑laid—
For he has seen the kind of tracks
That never truly fade.

### THE GIRL WHO FEARED THE MOONLIT PINES

#### Verse 1
She walks with steady footsteps
And her armor gleams like dawn—
But when the night wind stirs the pines,
Her courage feels withdrawn.
For somewhere in the shadows,
Where the silver moonlight spills,
She hears a distant memory
That time has never stilled.

#### Chorus
Oh the moonlit pines remember,
And the winter winds recall—
The cries that fade in darkness,
The names we never call.
And though she stands unshaken
When danger draws its lines—
Her heartbeat quickens softly
Near the moonlit, whispering pines.

#### Verse 2
She trains with blade and discipline,
Her stance both sharp and true—
But when the wolves begin to howl,
Her breath comes cold and few.
She hides it from her comrades,
She hides it from herself—
But fear can linger quietly
Like a book upon a shelf.

#### Chorus
Oh the moonlit pines remember,
And the winter winds recall—
The cries that fade in darkness,
The names we never call.
And though she stands unshaken
When danger draws its lines—
Her heartbeat quickens softly
Near the moonlit, whispering pines.

#### Bridge
Some wounds are carved in silence,
Some griefs are never named—
But still she walks the northern trails,
Determined, unashamed.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the moonlit pines remember,
And the winter winds recall—
The cries that fade in darkness,
The names we never call.
And though she stands unshaken
When danger draws its lines—
Her heartbeat quickens softly
Near the moonlit, whispering pines.

### THE SHEPHERD WHO HEARD TOO MUCH  


#### Verse 1
He walks the fields at sunrise
With a tremble in his stride—
A shepherd born to quiet work,
To hills both deep and wide.
But something in the shadows
Has left him pale and worn—
A whisper carried on the wind
From one cold winter morn.

#### Chorus
Oh the shepherd who heard too much,
Oh the voice that chilled his bone—
Some truths are meant for moonlight,
Some best left unknown.
And though he tries to steady
The shaking in his touch—
The hills remember clearly
What the shepherd heard too much.

#### Verse 2
He flinches at the nighttime,
At the rustle in the grass—
At distant howls that echo
Through the Welton mountain pass.
He never tells the full tale,
He never speaks the sound—
But fear has left its footprints
Where his courage once was found.

#### Chorus
Oh the shepherd who heard too much,
Oh the voice that chilled his bone—
Some truths are meant for moonlight,
Some best left unknown.
And though he tries to steady
The shaking in his touch—
The hills remember clearly
What the shepherd heard too much.

#### Bridge
Some nights he wakes in silence,
Some nights he wakes in cries—
But always with the memory
Of something wise… and wild.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the shepherd who heard too much,
Oh the voice that chilled his bone—
Some truths are meant for moonlight,
Some best left unknown.
And though he tries to steady
The shaking in his touch—
The hills remember clearly
What the shepherd heard too much.

### THE WOLF WHO WALKED LIKE A MAN  

#### Verse 1
They whisper of a silver wolf
Who walks the forest floor—
Not prowling like his kinfolk,
But thinking something more.
His eyes are sharp with knowing,
His steps both sure and slow—
As if he bears a question
That no creature ought to know.

#### Chorus
Oh the wolf who walked like a man,
With a mind both wild and wise—
A shadow born of winter,
A spark behind his eyes.
And though he leads in silence,
And though he hides his fear—
The wolf who walked like a man
Knows something waking near.

#### Verse 2
He watches from the treeline
When the moon is thin and pale—
A sentinel of secrets
In the frost along the trail.
Some say he speaks in glances,
Some say he dreams in fire—
But all agree his quiet gaze
Is older than desire.

#### Chorus
Oh the wolf who walked like a man,
With a mind both wild and wise—
A shadow born of winter,
A spark behind his eyes.
And though he leads in silence,
And though he hides his fear—
The wolf who walked like a man
Knows something waking near.

#### Bridge
Some gifts are born unwanted,
Some gifts are born of dread—
But still he guards the forest
Where the ancient paths are led.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the wolf who walked like a man,
With a mind both wild and wise—
A shadow born of winter,
A spark behind his eyes.
And though he leads in silence,
And though he hides his fear—
The wolf who walked like a man
Knows something waking near.

### THE FIRE IN THE WINTER PACK  

#### Verse 1
They tell of one with burning eyes
Who stalks the frozen glen—
A wolf whose growl is thunder,
Whose pride outmatches men.
He walks with fire beneath his fur,
A storm behind his stride—
And every step he takes declares
A challenge to the wild.

#### Chorus
Oh the fire in the winter pack,
Oh the fury in his breath—
A blaze that cuts through silence
Like a promise unto death.
And though the night grows colder,
And though the shadows track—
The fire in the winter pack
Will never turn his back.

#### Verse 2
Some say he dreams of kingdoms,
Of forests bowed in awe—
Of wolves who rise like sovereigns
Above the ancient law.
He stands upon the ridgeline
When the moon is sharp and bright—
A silhouette of hunger
Against the northern night.

#### Chorus
Oh the fire in the winter pack,
Oh the fury in his breath—
A blaze that cuts through silence
Like a promise unto death.
And though the night grows colder,
And though the shadows track—
The fire in the winter pack
Will never turn his back.

#### Bridge
Some flames are born of anger,
Some flames are born of pride—
But his was born of something
That stirs the world outside.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the fire in the winter pack,
Oh the fury in his breath—
A blaze that cuts through silence
Like a promise unto death.
And though the night grows colder,
And though the shadows track—
The fire in the winter pack
Will never turn his back.

### THE WIND THAT WOULDN’T SLEEP  


#### Verse 1
There’s a whisper in the treeline
When the dusk begins to fall—
A restless kind of murmuring
That stirs the hearts of all.
But she alone can hear it clear,
A voice beneath the deep—
A wind that wanders day and night
Because it cannot sleep.

#### Chorus
Oh the wind that wouldn’t slumber,
Oh the wind that wouldn’t rest—
It circles through the forest
Like a warning unexpressed.
And though she walks in quiet grace,
With calm in every breath—
She feels the stirring underfoot
Of something not at rest.

#### Verse 2
She listens to the trembling leaves,
The shifting of the loam.
She knows the forest’s every sigh,
Its heartbeat and its home.
But lately there’s a tension there,
A pulse beneath the stone—
As if the roots remember
Something ancient and unknown.

#### Chorus
Oh the wind that wouldn’t slumber,
Oh the wind that wouldn’t rest—
It circles through the forest
Like a warning unexpressed.
And though she walks in quiet grace,
With calm in every breath—
She feels the stirring underfoot
Of something not at rest.

#### Bridge
Some say she dreams in colors,
Some say she dreams in sound—
But she just keeps on listening
To the murmurs underground.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the wind that wouldn’t slumber,
Oh the wind that wouldn’t rest—
It circles through the forest
Like a warning unexpressed.
And though she walks in quiet grace,
With calm in every breath—
She feels the stirring underfoot
Of something not at rest.

### TOMORROW’S TUNE  


#### Verse 1
He strums a lively melody
In taverns warm and bright—
A gnome with jokes and jests to spare,
A spark in every night.
But sometimes in his singing,
A strange refrain appears—
A line that feels like memory
From days not yet near.

#### Chorus
Oh tomorrow’s tune is playing
In the corner of his mind—
A song that runs ahead of him,
A step beyond the time.
And though he laughs and shrugs it off,
And though he plays it soon—
There’s something oddly familiar
In the notes of tomorrow’s tune.

#### Verse 2
He claims it’s just coincidence,
A trick of bardic flair—
But some who hear his verses
Feel a shiver in the air.
For every now and then he hums
A chorus soft and low—
That hints at things unspoken,
At paths he shouldn’t know.

#### Chorus
Oh tomorrow’s tune is playing
In the corner of his mind—
A song that runs ahead of him,
A step beyond the time.
And though he laughs and shrugs it off,
And though he plays it soon—
There’s something oddly familiar
In the notes of tomorrow’s tune.

#### Bridge
Some songs are born of stories,
Some songs are born of fate—
But his seem born of moments
That haven’t happened yet.

#### Final Chorus
Oh tomorrow’s tune is playing
In the corner of his mind—
A song that runs ahead of him,
A step beyond the time.
And though he laughs and shrugs it off,
And though he plays it soon—
There’s something oddly familiar
In the notes of tomorrow’s tune.

### THE APPRENTICE AND THE BROKEN STAR  

#### Verse 1
She studies by the lantern’s glow,
Her quill a restless spark—
A mind too bright for quiet nights,
Too curious for the dark.
She speaks of falling starlight,
Of patterns in the sky—
And though her hands may tremble,
There’s fire in her eye.

#### Chorus
Oh the apprentice and the broken star,
Oh the questions without end—
She chases truths that flicker
Just beyond the river’s bend.
And though the world grows stranger,
And though the signs are far—
She keeps her gaze unshaken
On the path of the broken star.

#### Verse 2
She laughs at her own missteps,
She blushes at her fears—
But still she reads the shifting winds
That others never hear.
Some say she’s just a dreamer,
Some say she’s in too deep—
But she alone sees constellations
Where others only sleep.

#### Chorus
Oh the apprentice and the broken star,
Oh the questions without end—
She chases truths that flicker
Just beyond the river’s bend.
And though the world grows stranger,
And though the signs are far—
She keeps her gaze unshaken
On the path of the broken star.

#### Bridge
Some lights fall for a reason,
Some lights fall without aim—
But she will follow every spark
Until she learns its name.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the apprentice and the broken star,
Oh the questions without end—
She chases truths that flicker
Just beyond the river’s bend.
And though the world grows stranger,
And though the signs are far—
She keeps her gaze unshaken
On the path of the broken star.

### THE CANDLE THAT WON’T GO OUT  


#### Verse 1
He keeps a single candle
Burning through the night—
A beacon for the weary,
A soft and steady light.
He tends it with devotion,
He guards it with a prayer—
And though his smile is gentle,
There’s sorrow settled there.

#### Chorus
Oh the candle that won’t go out,
Though winter howls and cries—
A flame that stands against the dark,
A hope that never dies.
And though his heart is heavy,
And though he walks in doubt—
He keeps his vigil faithfully
With the candle that won’t go out.

#### Verse 2
He listens to confession,
He comforts those in pain—
But when the chapel empties,
His tears fall like the rain.
For some wounds have no healing,
Some losses have no name—
Yet still he lights the lantern
And tends the fragile flame.

#### Chorus
Oh the candle that won’t go out,
Though winter howls and cries—
A flame that stands against the dark,
A hope that never dies.
And though his heart is heavy,
And though he walks in doubt—
He keeps his vigil faithfully
With the candle that won’t go out.

#### Bridge
Some prayers are made in silence,
Some griefs are held alone—
But still he lights the candle
For the ones who won’t come home.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the candle that won’t go out,
Though winter howls and cries—
A flame that stands against the dark,
A hope that never dies.
And though his heart is heavy,
And though he walks in doubt—
He keeps his vigil faithfully
With the candle that won’t go out.

### THE MASTER WHO WALKED INTO WINTER  

#### Verse 1
They say he trained in silence,
Where the frost meets morning’s breath—
A student of the stillness,
Of the space between each step.
But when they speak of winter,
A shadow fills his eyes—
For one who walked before him
Never made the return rise.

#### Chorus
Oh the master lost to winter,
Oh the path that fades to white—
Some journeys end in daylight,
Some vanish into night.
And though he walks with balance,
And though his heart is clear—
The master lost to winter
Still whispers in his ear.

#### Verse 2
He listens to the snowfall
As if it holds a clue—
A secret in the quiet
Only patient hearts pursue.
He never speaks the full tale,
He never names the cost—
But every time the cold wind stirs,
He mourns what he has lost.

#### Chorus
Oh the master lost to winter,
Oh the path that fades to white—
Some journeys end in daylight,
Some vanish into night.
And though he walks with balance,
And though his heart is clear—
The master lost to winter
Still whispers in his ear.

#### Bridge
Some truths are found in stillness,
Some truths are found in pain—
But he keeps walking forward,
Through frost and wind and rain.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the master lost to winter,
Oh the path that fades to white—
Some journeys end in daylight,
Some vanish into night.
And though he walks with balance,
And though his heart is clear—
The master lost to winter
Still whispers in his ear.

### THE QUIET ROAD OF GUZ  

#### Verse 1
He walks with heavy footsteps,
But his heart is gentle‑made—
A man who’s learned the weight of wrongs,
And how the past won’t fade.
He keeps his words in careful hands,
His temper held in check—
But sometimes in the silent hours,
Old whispers brush his neck.

#### Chorus
Oh the quiet road he follows,
Oh the burdens that he bears—
A path of slow redemption
Through winters no one shares.
And though he stands with courage,
And though he strives to choose—
The quiet road grows longer
For a man once known as Guz.

#### Verse 2
He flinches at the flicker
Of magic in the air—
Not fear of spell or sorcery,
But memories laid bare.
He tries to drown the echoes,
He tries to walk them down—
But shadows cling to those who’ve worn
A darker, older crown.

#### Chorus
Oh the quiet road he follows,
Oh the burdens that he bears—
A path of slow redemption
Through winters no one shares.
And though he stands with courage,
And though he strives to choose—
The quiet road grows longer
For a man once known as Guz.

#### Bridge
Some voices fade with distance,
Some linger in the bone—
But he keeps walking forward,
Determined and alone.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the quiet road he follows,
Oh the burdens that he bears—
A path of slow redemption
Through winters no one shares.
And though he stands with courage,
And though he strives to choose—
The quiet road grows longer
For a man once known as Guz.

### ASH ON THE SHRINE  

#### Verse 1
They found her in the ruins
Where the sacred candles lay—
Their wax still warm with memory,
Their light long swept away.
She knelt among the ashes,
Her armor scorched and torn—
And though she spoke no vow aloud,
A fiercer oath was born.

#### Chorus
Oh the ash upon the shrine
Still clings to her like fate.
A promise forged in silence,
A fire that will not wait.
And though her voice is gentle,
And though her steps align—
There burns a quiet fury
In the ash upon the shrine.

#### Verse 2
She walks with holy purpose,
Her gaze both calm and clear—
But something in her shadow
Still trembles with the fear.
Not fear of death or darkness,
Not fear of tooth or scale—
But fear of failing those she served,
Of letting justice fail.

#### Chorus
Oh the ash upon the shrine
Still clings to her like fate.
A promise forged in silence,
A fire that will not wait.
And though her voice is gentle,
And though her steps align—
There burns a quiet fury
In the ash upon the shrine.

#### Bridge
Some wounds are made of fire,
Some vows are made of stone—
But hers was made of both at once,
And she bears it all alone.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the ash upon the shrine
Still clings to her like fate.
A promise forged in silence,
A fire that will not wait.
And though her voice is gentle,
And though her steps align—
There burns a quiet fury
In the ash upon the shrine.

### THE FIRE THAT TREMBLES  


#### Verse 1
They say his flame burns steady,
A torch against the cold—
A dragonborn of noble line,
With fire in his soul.
But sometimes when the night grows still,
And winter grips the air—
His breath comes sharp and ragged,
As if something stirs elsewhere.

#### Chorus
Oh the fire that trembles,
Oh the flame that knows its kin—
A spark that flares in warning
Of the storm that waits within.
And though he stands unshaken,
And though his pride is true—
The fire that trembles in his chest
Knows more than he can view.

#### Verse 2
He speaks of ancient stories,
Of wings that split the sky—
Of battles carved in memory
Long before his time.
But when the distant thunder rolls,
Or shadows coil and climb—
He stiffens, as if hearing
A call from some old rhyme.

#### Chorus
Oh the fire that trembles,
Oh the flame that knows its kin—
A spark that flares in warning
Of the storm that waits within.
And though he stands unshaken,
And though his pride is true—
The fire that trembles in his chest
Knows more than he can view.

#### Bridge
Some blood remembers battles,
Some blood remembers flame—
And his remembers something
That will not speak its name.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the fire that trembles,
Oh the flame that knows its kin—
A spark that flares in warning
Of the storm that waits within.
And though he stands unshaken,
And though his pride is true—
The fire that trembles in his chest
Knows more than he can view.

### THE PATRON’S WHISPER  

#### Verse 1
He walks with silver laughter,
A shadow at his heel—
A tiefling with a wandering smile
And secrets kept concealed.
He charms the crowded taverns,
He dazzles every hall—
But sometimes when the candles dim,
He listens for a call.

#### Chorus
Oh the patron’s whisper,
Soft as falling snow—
A voice that curls around him
From places none can know.
And though he plays the jester,
And though his grin is wide—
The patron’s whisper lingers
Like a shadow at his side.

#### Verse 2
He speaks in clever riddles,
He dances through the night—
But when the moon grows heavy,
His eyes lose all their light.
For something in the quiet
Reminds him who he serves—
A presence cold and patient,
A pull he can’t unnerve.

#### Chorus
Oh the patron’s whisper,
Soft as falling snow—
A voice that curls around him
From places none can know.
And though he plays the jester,
And though his grin is wide—
The patron’s whisper lingers
Like a shadow at his side.

#### Bridge
Some bargains leave a mark,
Some promises a chain—
But he still walks in elegance
Through snowfall and through rain.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the patron’s whisper,
Soft as falling snow—
A voice that curls around him
From places none can know.
And though he plays the jester,
And though his grin is wide—
The patron’s whisper lingers
Like a shadow at his side.

### THE GIRL WITH THE DAWN IN HER HANDS

#### Verse 1
He speaks of her in whispers,
As if the dawn might hear—
A girl with eyes like morning light,
A laugh both bright and clear.
He keeps her memory gentle,
He keeps her story warm—
A fragile spark of sunlight
Preserved against the storm.

#### Chorus
Oh the girl with the dawn in her hands,
Oh the hope she used to bring—
A promise wrapped in laughter,
A quiet, budding spring.
And though the world grew colder,
And though he understands—
He still sees her in the sunrise,
With the dawn held in her hands.

#### Verse 2
He walks the fields at daybreak,
Where she once used to roam—
And every golden shimmer
Feels like she’s coming home.
He never speaks of sorrow,
He never names the ache—
But grief can bloom in silence
Like frost upon a lake.

#### Chorus
Oh the girl with the dawn in her hands,
Oh the hope she used to bring—
A promise wrapped in laughter,
A quiet, budding spring.
And though the world grew colder,
And though he understands—
He still sees her in the sunrise,
With the dawn held in her hands.

#### Bridge
Some lights are gone too early,
Some lights are never gone—
For morning keeps their memory
In every breaking dawn.

#### Final Chorus
Oh the girl with the dawn in her hands,
Oh the hope she used to bring—
A promise wrapped in laughter,
A quiet, budding spring.
And though the world grew colder,
And though he understands—
He still sees her in the sunrise,
With the dawn held in her hands.
