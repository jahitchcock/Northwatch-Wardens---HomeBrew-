# Welcome to Northreach




Northreach is the kind of place that doesn’t announce itself with walls and banners — it reveals itself mile by mile. Wind combs through pine and scrub, the road narrows and widens like a breathing thing, and every settlement feels earned: a warm window in a wide, cold land.


The Wardens’ work begins where ordinary help ends. Their name passes from hearth to hearth in the same breath as practical advice: “Stay on the road,” “Don’t travel alone after dusk,” “If you’re in trouble, get word to the Waystone.”

When winter bites early, when rumors travel faster than wagons, and when something in the dark makes even seasoned hunters hesitate, people look for the ones who will show up anyway—boots muddy, lamp lit, and questions asked only after everyone is safe.

# 1) Northreach Lore Primer (Common Knowledge)

Northreach is a frontier region—**wide roads, sparse settlements, and long stretches of wilderness** stitched together by stubborn persistence and the promise of the next warm hearth. Here, the horizon is big enough to make even confident travelers feel small: dark treelines crowd the road’s edge, weather turns on a whim, and the silence between wagon ruts can feel like it’s listening.

Life in Northreach runs on practical virtues. A sharp axe, a steady hand, and the habit of keeping your word matter more than titles. Folks remember who mends a broken fence without being asked, who shares a lantern when the fog rolls in, and who pays their tab before the dawn. Community isn’t a slogan out here—it’s a tool for survival, as vital as rope or tinder.

Trouble comes with the territory, and everyone knows it. Most dangers are ordinary: hunger, cold, and distance. Some are less easily named—strange tracks after fresh snow, animals that won’t spook, lights where there shouldn’t be any. Whatever the cause, Northreach respects anyone willing to step forward, take responsibility, and see a hard problem through to the end.


## 1.1 The Northwatch Wardens (The Guild)

The Northwatch Wardens are a contract-based guild headquartered at the **Waystone Inn**.

#### What most locals believe about Wardens:
- They handle problems that are too dangerous, too strange, or too urgent for town militias.
- They’re not nobles, not soldiers, and not priests—just professionals with a code.
- They can be hired, but they’re expected to protect innocents and keep their word.

#### Guild leadership:
- **Marshal Brenna Thorne** — the public face and final call on field matters.
- **Steward Mara Fenwick** — logistics, supplies, pay, and the contract board.
- **Lorewarden Elric Vael** — records, reports, and “what we know so far.”

## 1.2 Daily life on the frontier

#### Work and trade
- Most folk farm, herd, cut timber, trap, fish, or run small services for travelers.
- Coin is welcome, but **barter** is common away from trade hubs.

#### Law and order
- Settlements generally rely on councils, elders, or a small watch.
- Serious disputes tend to be settled by **community pressure** first, then fines, then exile.
- Outsiders who cause trouble are dealt with quickly—frontier towns can’t afford long grudges.

#### Hospitality and caution
- A warm meal and a bed can be had—if you’re respectful.
- People share warnings freely, but details are often colored by fear and superstition.

## 1.3 Travel in Northreach

#### Roads and routes
- Roads are real but imperfect: washouts, mud, and fallen trees are routine.
- Travel is slower in bad weather; caravans prefer predictable routes between settlements.

#### What travelers pack
- Oilskin cloak, spare socks, rope, a lantern, trail rations, and a waterskin.
- A small gift (tea, salt, needles) opens doors in hard places.

#### Common dangers
- Wolves and other predators
- Bandits and opportunists
- Sudden weather shifts
- “Old places” in the wilds that sensible folk avoid

## 1.4 Magic (as everyday people understand it)
Northreach is not a place where magic is commonplace.
- Most residents have **heard of magic**.
- Fewer have **seen** it.
- Those who have tend to talk about it carefully—half in awe, half in fear.
