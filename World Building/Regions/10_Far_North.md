# The Far North — The Aeorian Ruinlands

**Theme:** Frozen wasteland, buried megastructures, ancient awakening  
**Tone:** Bleak, cosmic, dangerous  
**Role in the World:** True origin of the Aeorian Echo; endgame region; home of Salsvault

---

## Overview

The Far North is a frozen wasteland of blizzards, shattered glaciers, and ancient ruins buried beneath the ice. Few who travel there return, and those who do speak of strange lights beneath the snow, humming winds, and structures that seem to shift when unobserved.

*"Where the world ends, and something older begins."*

This region is the keystone of the entire campaign arc—the source from which the Aeorian Echo radiates outward, affecting Northreach and beyond. While Salsvault (from *Frozen Sick*) is the most immediate connection to the Wardens' early missions, it is merely one node in a vast network of buried Aeorian facilities.

The Far North is not just dangerous—it is changing.

---

## Player-Safe Summary

The Far North is a land of:
- **Deadly cold** — Temperatures that kill unprotected travelers within minutes
- **Forgotten civilizations** — Ancient structures half-melted into the ice
- **Strange magical disturbances** — Lights beneath the snow, humming winds
- **Unknowable secrets** — Things older than any living race

The **Aeorian Echo**—the magical disturbance affecting Northreach—is believed to originate somewhere deep within this region, though no one knows how or why.

Travelers avoid the Far North unless they have no choice.  
Scholars dream of exploring it.  
Fools die in it.

## DM-Only Summary

The Far North is the true origin point of the Aeorian Echo and the first region where the ancient artifacts began to stir.

This region contains:
- **Salsvault** (canon from *Frozen Sick*)
- **Multiple buried Aeorian megastructures**
- **Dormant artifact cores**
- **The earliest signs of full awakening**

### The Truth About This Region

The Far North is not just dangerous—it is **actively transforming**:

- The ice is cracking in unnatural patterns
- The auroras pulse in rhythmic intervals
- Creatures mutate in ways that mirror ancient Aeorian experiments
- Deep beneath the glaciers, the artifacts are beginning to resonate

**This region is the endgame of the campaign's mystery arc.**

The players' early adventures in Northreach are merely symptoms of what is happening here. Eventually, they must come north to confront the source—or risk the entire world changing in ways they cannot predict.

---

## Geography & Climate

The Far North is defined by extremes.

### Climate

- **Perpetual winter** — No true summer; temperatures rarely above freezing
- **Blinding snowstorms** — Whiteout conditions lasting days
- **Killing cold** — Unprotected travelers die within minutes
- **Sudden magical anomalies** — Weather patterns disrupted by the Echo
- **Eerie stillness** — Between storms, the silence is oppressive and unnatural

### Terrain Types

**The Shatterspine Glacier**  
A massive ice shelf fractured by ancient impacts. Beneath it lie the largest Aeorian ruins. The cracks run in geometric patterns—too precise to be natural. Something underneath is breaking through.

**The Frostgrave Expanse**  
A flat, windswept tundra where the ground hums faintly at night. Snow here sparkles with an inner light after dark. Travelers report feeling watched by the earth itself.

**The Black Ice Chasm**  
A mile-deep fissure exposing crystalline structures that are not natural. The walls shimmer with veins of unknown material. Climbers who descend report hearing voices in languages no one recognizes.

**The Silent Peaks**  
Mountains where sound behaves strangely—echoes repeat hours later, sometimes days. Words spoken near these peaks have been heard elsewhere in Northreach, carried impossibly far.

**The Ruinfields**  
Scattered remnants of Aeorian cities, half-melted into the ice. Metal spires jut from glaciers. Stone facades emerge during brief thaws. The ruins shift position between visits—or so survivors claim.

## Major Locations

### 1. Salsvault (Canon Location)

**Type:** Buried Aeorian research facility  
**Status:** Active and destabilizing  
**Danger Level:** Extreme  
**Campaign Role:** First documented source of the Echo

**Significance:**
- The buried ruin from *Frozen Sick*
- Where Aeorian spores and Frigid Woe originated
- Contains active constructs and preserved experiments
- **The first place where the Aeorian Echo reactivated**

**Current State:**
- Spores continue spreading from containment breach
- Constructs patrol ancient corridors
- Strange signals emanate from deeper levels
- Local wildlife mutates near the facility

**Connection to Campaign:**
- This remains exactly as written in *Frozen Sick*
- We simply place it within the broader Ruinlands context
- Players discover it's one node in a larger network
- The Wardens' earliest clues originate here

---

### 2. The Heart of Winter

**Type:** Massive dormant artifact core  
**Size:** Cathedral-sized structure beneath the ice  
**Status:** Awakening  
**Threat Level:** Apocalyptic

**Description:**
A massive, circular depression in the ice where the temperature drops unnaturally low—even by Far North standards. At its center lies a dormant artifact core the size of a cathedral, visible through translucent ice.

**Observable Phenomena:**
- **The Pulse:** It pulses once every few days
- **The Wave:** Each pulse sends a wave of magical disturbance southward
- **The Echo:** This is the true source of the Aeorian Echo
- **The Change:** The pulses are accelerating

**What It Actually Is (DM Only):**
The Heart is a primary control node for the continental Aeorian network. It was designed to coordinate magical infrastructure across the entire Age of Arcanum civilization. Its reactivation is not accidental—something or someone triggered it deliberately.

**Adventure Implications:**
- Late-campaign destination
- Requires extensive preparation and protection magic
- Contains answers to the Echo mystery
- Confronting it determines the campaign's resolution

---

### 3. The Obsidian Lattice

**Type:** Ancient artifact array  
**Appearance:** Forest of black crystalline spires  
**Function:** Communication/coordination network  
**Status:** Reactivating

**Description:**
A forest of black crystalline spires rising from the ice, each twenty to fifty feet tall. They hum with faint resonance, creating an eerie chord that shifts with the wind. The pattern seems deliberate—too regular to be natural.

**Scholarly Theories:**
- Dwarven scholars believe they are "frozen lightning"
- Elven scouts report they predate modern civilizations
- Solaris researchers theorize they're communication devices

**The Truth (DM Only):**
They are artifact antennae—part of the Aeorian network's long-range communication system. As the Heart of Winter reactivates, these spires begin transmitting again, sending signals to other dormant facilities across the continent.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- A Warden team vanished near here—their last message mentioned "singing ice"
- The spires' resonance frequency matches strange dreams Northreach residents have been experiencing
- Touching a spire reveals fragmented visions of the ancient past

### 4. The White Maw

**Type:** Ancient labyrinth beneath the ice  
**Access:** Massive sinkhole descending into darkness  
**Age:** Predates Aeor itself  
**Status:** Something sleeps at the bottom

**Description:**
A sinkhole that descends into a labyrinth of tunnels carved with symbols that predate Aeor. The walls are covered in script no scholar can decipher—not Draconic, not Primordial, not any known language.

**Explorers' Reports:**
- Temperature increases as you descend (impossibly)
- The symbols seem to shift when not directly observed
- Some tunnels lead to chambers filled with petrified organic matter
- Sound echoes upward for hours after being made

**The Mystery (DM Only):**
The Aeor civilization built atop something even older. The White Maw predates their arrival—they found it and tried to study it. Whatever sleeps at the bottom has not yet stirred... but the Aeorian reactivation may wake it.

**Adventure Implications:**
- Endgame dungeon for high-level parties
- Contains pre-Aeorian artifacts with unknown properties
- Reveals that the Aeorian Echo is only the beginning
- Whatever is down there is not human, elven, or dwarven

---

### 5. The Aurora Gate

**Type:** Ancient portal hub  
**Appearance:** Ring of standing stones glowing with shifting colors  
**Status:** Magically active but unpredictable  
**Function:** Once a teleportation nexus; now a hazard

**Description:**
A ring of standing stones, each fifteen feet tall, arranged in a perfect circle. The stones glow with shifting auroral colors—green, blue, violet, gold. The air inside the ring is warm, despite the surrounding cold.

**Current Behavior:**
- Teleportation magic behaves unpredictably here
- Sometimes functions as intended
- Sometimes teleports travelers to wrong locations
- Sometimes teleports travelers to wrong *times*
- Sometimes doesn't teleport at all—just disintegrates matter

**Scholarly Interest:**
- Solaris researchers desperately want to study it
- Vharoxis smugglers use it despite the danger
- Some believe it connects to other portal networks worldwide

**The Truth (DM Only):**
The Aurora Gate was a hub in the Aeorian fast-travel network. As the system reactivates, the Gate is trying to reconnect to nodes that no longer exist—or exist in altered states. Its unpredictability reflects the broken state of the network itself.

**Adventure Hook:**
A Solaris scholar hires the party to escort them to the Aurora Gate. They want to study its reactivation patterns. They do not mention they plan to activate it themselves.

## Inhabitants

### Survivors & Nomads

A few hardy groups live on the edges of the Ruinlands:

**Reindeer Herders**
- Follow migrating herds across the tundra
- Know safe paths through the wastes
- Treat the ruins as taboo—never enter them
- Notice the changes but don't speak of them to outsiders

**Ice-Fisher Clans**
- Live in semi-permanent camps near unfrozen water
- Trade fish, furs, and survival supplies
- Maintain oral histories of the Ruinlands
- Some families have been here for generations

**Scavengers**
- Strip metal and artifacts from accessible ruins
- Desperate or foolish enough to ignore the dangers
- Sell finds to smugglers and scholars
- Mortality rate is extremely high

**Key Characteristic:**
All of these groups **avoid the deep north**. There are places even they will not go.

---

### Echo-Touched Creatures

The Aeorian Echo mutates wildlife in visible ways:

**Wolves with Crystalline Growths**
- Fur replaced by ice-like crystal in patches
- Eyes glow faintly in darkness
- Pack tactics more coordinated than natural
- Some show signs of emerging intelligence

**Mammoths That Hum**
- Emit low-frequency resonance matching the artifact cores
- Herds move in geometric patterns
- Occasionally stop and stare at ruins for hours
- Unnatural longevity—some may be ancient

**Owlbears with Bioluminescent Feathers**
- Plumage glows in response to magical activity
- More aggressive near artifact sites
- Feathers valued by mages as spell components
- Intelligence noticeably higher than normal

**Erratic Ice Elementals**
- Behavior unpredictable and dangerous
- Sometimes ignore travelers, sometimes attack without warning
- Occasionally found standing motionless near ruins
- May be responding to artifact signals

**Campaign Role:**
These creatures foreshadow what's happening beneath the ice. Players encountering them in Northreach should eventually recognize the pattern: the closer to the Far North, the more pronounced the mutations.

---

### Ancient Constructs

Some Aeorian machines still function—barely:

**Floating Sentinels**
- Hovering spheres of metal and magic
- Patrol ancient perimeters that no longer make sense
- Attack intruders, but also sometimes guide travelers to safety
- Seem to be following pre-programmed routines

**Dormant War Golems**
- Massive humanoid constructs frozen in ice
- Occasionally one awakens and wanders for days before stopping
- Still follow ancient combat protocols
- Will defend Aeorian sites if threatened

**Data-Recording Drones**
- Small flying constructs that observe and record
- Seem to be gathering information for something
- Non-hostile but disturbingly intelligent
- Occasionally follow travelers for miles

**Containment Guardians**
- Protect specific locations with lethal efficiency
- Still functional after millennia
- React to any intrusion with overwhelming force
- Cannot be reasoned with—pure function

**Current State:**
Most are inactive. Some are waking up. A few never stopped.

As the Aeorian network reactivates, more constructs come online each month.

## Factions Active in the Far North

### 1. The Northwatch Wardens

**Presence:** Small investigative teams  
**Goal:** Understand the Echo's origin  
**Success Rate:** Low  
**Status:** Many do not return

**Operations:**
- Sent teams after the *Frozen Sick* incident
- Mapping the extent of the Ruinlands
- Documenting mutations and anomalies
- Attempting to find other artifact sites

**Current Situation:**
Marshal Thorne knows the Wardens are outmatched here. Every expedition costs lives or sanity. But understanding the source may be the only way to stop the spread.

---

### 2. Solaris Scholars

**Sent By:** The Veilbound Circle and Chorus of the Eclipse  
**Goal:** Knowledge—and political leverage  
**Approach:** Academic expeditions with mercenary escorts  
**Motivation:** Whoever controls ancient knowledge controls the future

**Methods:**
- Well-funded expeditions with protective magic
- Retrieval of artifacts and documents
- Mapping and cataloging sites
- Competing with each other as much as investigating

**Danger:**
They seek knowledge without understanding the consequences. Some Solaris scholars believe the artifacts can be controlled, studied, even replicated. They are dangerously wrong.

---

### 3. Dwarven Deep-Readers

**Origin:** The Stonebound Depths  
**Philosophy:** "The Ruinlands are the deepest verse of the world's song"  
**Approach:** Geomantic divination and stone-reading  
**Status:** Dangerously close to discovering the truth

**Beliefs:**
- The artifacts resonate with the stone itself
- The Ruinlands are not ruins—they're instruments
- The "song" the artifacts sing predates mortal civilization
- Understanding the resonance pattern reveals the truth

**Current Activities:**
- Listening to the stone in key locations
- Correlating tremors and pulses across the continent
- Building a map of the artifact network
- One group is camped near the Heart of Winter

**Threat:**
If they fully decode the resonance pattern, they might accidentally trigger something catastrophic. Their curiosity may doom them—and everyone else.

---

### 4. Vharoxis Smugglers

**Motivation:** Artifact fragments fetch astronomical prices  
**Morality:** They don't care about consequences  
**Network:** Well-organized and ruthless  
**Status:** Making things worse

**Operations:**
- Stripping artifacts from accessible sites
- Bribing or threatening local nomads
- Using the Aurora Gate despite its instability
- Selling fragments to the highest bidder worldwide

**Impact:**
Every artifact they remove destabilizes the network further. They don't realize—or don't care—that their theft is accelerating the awakening.

**Adventure Hook:**
A smuggler caravan is transporting a fragment that should not exist—a piece of the Heart of Winter itself. If it reaches Vharoxis, the black market will trigger bidding wars among the continent's most dangerous powers.

## Eclipse Day in the Far North

### What Happened

Eclipse Day—the astronomical event that coincided with the first major Aeorian reactivation—hit the Far North first and hardest.

**The Trigger Event:**
- A massive pulse from the Heart of Winter
- Visible from hundreds of miles away
- Accompanied by auroral displays that lit the night sky
- Felt as far south as Solaris

**Immediate Effects:**
- Reactivation of several artifact nodes simultaneously
- Awakening of dormant constructs across the Ruinlands
- Surge in magical anomalies
- Temperature fluctuations—some areas became colder, others warmer
- Mass mutation events in local wildlife

**The Cascade:**
This was the **first true awakening event**. The pulse from the Heart of Winter propagated through the continental network:

1. Far North nodes activated first (including Salsvault)
2. The Echo spread outward in waves
3. Northreach felt it as strange occurrences (wolves, spores)
4. Other regions experienced their own manifestations
5. The world felt the aftershock but didn't understand the source

**DM Note:**
Eclipse Day was not a coincidence. Something—or someone—used the astronomical alignment to trigger the reactivation. The question is: who? And why now, after millennia of dormancy?

---

## Adventure Hooks

### For Early Campaigns (Levels 1-5)
While the party is in Northreach, they hear rumors:

- "Traders from the far north say the auroras have turned strange colors"
- "A reindeer herder claims to have seen metal towers rising from the ice"
- "Frozen fish brought south glow faintly in the dark"
- "Mammoths are migrating in the wrong direction—toward the ruins"

These hints establish the Far North as a distant threat that's growing closer.

---

### For Mid-Level Campaigns (Levels 6-10)
The Wardens send the party north:

**Missing Expedition**
A Warden team vanished near the Obsidian Lattice. Their last message mentioned "singing ice." Find them—or find out what happened.

**Escort Mission**
A Solaris scholar hires the party to escort them to the Aurora Gate. They want to study its reactivation patterns. They neglect to mention they plan to activate it themselves.

**The Deep-Reader's Request**
A dwarven Deep-Reader believes the Heart of Winter is "speaking" and wants help deciphering it. They're camped dangerously close to the source.

---

### For High-Level Campaigns (Levels 11-16)

**The Smuggler's Cargo**
A Vharoxis smuggler caravan is transporting a fragment of the Heart of Winter. Multiple factions want it. The party must decide whether to destroy it, return it, or keep it from those who would misuse it.

**The Mutation Witness**
A creature mutated by the Echo wanders south into Northreach, carrying a clue inside its crystalline growths—coordinates to a previously unknown artifact site.

**The Network Awakens**
Artifact sites across the Far North are activating in sequence. The pattern suggests a countdown. The party must reach the Heart of Winter before the final activation.

---

### For Epic Campaigns (Levels 17-20)

**The Final Confrontation**
The Heart of Winter is fully awakening. Its pulses are increasing in frequency and intensity. If it completes activation, the entire continental network will come online—with consequences no one can predict.

The party must travel to the Heart, understand its purpose, and make a choice:
- Shut it down (if possible)
- Redirect it (if feasible)
- Destroy it (and risk catastrophic magical backlash)
- Let it complete (and see what happens)

## How the Far North Connects to the Repo

This region is the macro-scale version of everything happening in Northreach.

### Direct Connections

**Salsvault**
- One of many buried Aeorian sites in the Far North
- Players encounter it in *Frozen Sick*
- Later realize it's a node in a much larger network

**The Aeorian Echo**
- Originates from the Heart of Winter
- Spreads outward through the artifact network
- Reaches Northreach first (geographically closest)
- Effects ripple across the continent

**Warden Missions**
- The early adventures are symptoms of a larger awakening
- *Wolves of Welton*: Intelligence mutation from Echo exposure
- *Frozen Sick*: Direct contamination from Salsvault
- *Temple of Dragonknights*: Factions exploiting amplified magic
- All point back to the Far North as the source

### Campaign Escalation

**Tier 1-2 (Levels 1-8):**
The Far North is distant rumor and mystery. Players deal with its effects in Northreach but don't travel there.

**Tier 3 (Levels 9-14):**
Expeditions to the Far North become necessary. Players begin mapping the artifact network and understanding the scope of the threat.

**Tier 4 (Levels 15-20):**
The Heart of Winter becomes the final confrontation. Everything the players learned in Northreach prepared them for this moment.

### Thematic Resonance

**Northreach Theme:** "The frontier where old magic breaks through"  
**Far North Theme:** "The source from which old magic emerges"

Northreach is the **first impact zone**.  
The Far North is the **origin point**.  
The rest of the world will feel the consequences soon.

## Secrets and Revelations

### For the DM (Hidden Truths)

**About the Reactivation:**
- Not natural awakening—deliberately triggered
- Eclipse Day was the activation key
- Someone or something coordinated the timing
- The network is still incomplete—more activations coming

**About the Heart of Winter:**
- Originally designed as a continental magical infrastructure hub
- Coordinated everything from weather control to teleportation
- The civilization that built it had capabilities beyond modern magic
- It's not malfunctioning—it's working exactly as designed

**About the Creatures:**
- Mutations aren't random—they're adaptive responses
- The artifacts are "upgrading" local life to match ancient patterns
- Some mutations grant intelligence because the network needs operators
- The end state: a world where all life is integrated into the network

**About the Other Regions:**
- Every major region has dormant artifact sites
- The Far North activated first because it has the highest concentration
- As the Heart of Winter pulses, other regions' artifacts wake
- Eventually, the entire continental network will be online

**About What Comes Next:**
- The artifacts are preparing for something
- The pre-Aeorian ruins (White Maw) suggest this has happened before
- Each cycle, the network reactivates and transforms the world
- This cycle has only just begun

*"The world ends in the Far North. But something older than the world begins there too."*

— From the final expedition log of Warden-Captain Torrhen Blackice
