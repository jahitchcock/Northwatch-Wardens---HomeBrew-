# The Sunken Dominion

Drowned Civilization of the Deep  
**Theme:** Lost magic, drowned cities, deep-sea artifacts  
**Tone:** Haunting, alien, submerged

## Summary

Far beneath the waves of Aevoria's western and southern seas lies the Sunken Dominion, a drowned civilization whose ruins stretch across the ocean floor. Sailors speak of shattered towers glimpsed through clear water, glowing currents that pulse like veins, and strange shapes moving in the deep.

Most believe the Dominion was once a powerful coastal empire swallowed by a cataclysm long before recorded history. Others claim it was never a surface civilization at all—that it was always a realm of the deep.

What is known is this:
- Strange relics wash ashore after storms
- Glowing currents appear without warning
- Sea creatures behave unnaturally
- Divers report hearing faint, rhythmic humming beneath the waves

The Sunken Dominion is a place of beauty, terror, and secrets older than any living culture.

## Geography & Climate

The Dominion spans the ocean floor along Aevoria's western and southern coasts.

### Key Features

**The Glassspire Ruins**  
Crystalline towers jutting from the seabed, visible on clear days through shallow water. They refract light in impossible patterns, creating kaleidoscopic displays that mesmerize sailors.

**The Abyssal Steps**  
A massive underwater staircase descending into darkness. Each step is perfectly carved, geometric, and far too large for human construction. No one knows what lies at the bottom.

**The Luminous Trenches**  
Deep rifts glowing with bioluminescent currents. The light pulses rhythmically, like a heartbeat. Some divers claim the pulse has been getting faster.

**The Coral Labyrinth**  
A maze of living coral grown around ancient structures. The coral formations seem to follow patterns that don't match natural growth. Navigating it is nearly impossible without local knowledge.

**The Drowned Gate**  
A colossal archway half-buried in silt, made of an unknown metal that doesn't rust or corrode. Strange symbols cover its surface. Since Eclipse Day, the symbols occasionally glow.

### The Waters Above

The waters above the Dominion are prone to:
- Sudden storms appearing without warning
- Glowing tides that leave phosphorescent patterns on beaches
- Strange magnetic disturbances that confuse compasses
- Currents that flow in impossible directions
- Unexplained temperature changes

## Major Coastal Points of Interest

### 1. Tidebreaker Point

A cliffside settlement overlooking the Dominion's nearest ruins.

**Population:** ~1,200  
**Known for:**
- Deep-sea divers willing to risk the depths
- Salvage crews bringing up strange relics
- Scholars from Solaris studying glowing currents
- The best view of the Glassspire Ruins

Tidebreaker Point is the safest place to observe the Dominion—from a distance. The settlement has strict laws about what can be brought up from below. Too many divers have returned changed, obsessed, or not at all.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Lighthouse of Memory:** A tall tower where divers report their findings (and are checked for mental stability)
- **The Drowned Archive:** A library dedicated to cataloging every relic and report from the Dominion
- **The Diver's Rest:** A tavern where salvage crews gather to trade stories (and warnings)

### 2. The Lantern Shoals

A cluster of islands surrounded by glowing waters.

**Population:** ~300 (spread across multiple islands)  
**Known for:**
- Eerie night-lights visible from miles away
- Strange fish migrations that don't follow seasonal patterns
- Rumors of "singing tides"—waves that produce musical notes
- Isolation and superstition

Locals avoid the shoals after dark. They've learned the hard way that the glowing waters attract more than just fish. Strange shapes move beneath the surface, and sometimes they come ashore.

**Key Features:**
- **The Beacon Rocks:** Natural formations that glow at night (the glow has been intensifying)
- **Whisper Bay:** A cove where the water seems to murmur in voices
- **The Watcher's Isle:** An abandoned watchtower, now avoided by everyone

### 3. The Drowned Observatory

A partially submerged tower built by ancient scholars, now half-reclaimed by the sea.

**Current Uses:**
- Solaris researchers studying oceanic magic
- Druidic tide-watchers monitoring the sea's behavior
- Smugglers hiding relics from official eyes
- A neutral meeting ground for competing interests

The tower's lower levels are flooded and dangerous. Some say there are chambers below that haven't been opened in centuries. Others claim the tower itself is sinking deeper every year.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Star Chamber:** An observation room with crystal windows looking into the deep
- **The Tide Pools:** Artificial pools that fill and drain with the tides, showing strange visions
- **The Sealed Archives:** Locked chambers said to contain pre-cataclysm knowledge

## Culture & Society Today

There is no living civilization in the Sunken Dominion—only those who come to exploit, study, or worship it.

### The Salvagers

**Philosophy:** See the Dominion as a treasure trove  
**Methods:** Deep-diving, dredging, theft  
**Risks:** Death, madness, legal trouble

Salvage crews brave the depths for profit. They bring up relics, art, strange metal fragments, and occasionally something that still works. Competition is fierce, and many crews guard their diving sites jealously.

The best divers are respected (and feared). They develop an almost supernatural sense for danger. They also tend to die young.

### The Scholars

**Philosophy:** See the Dominion as a mystery to solve  
**Methods:** Research, exploration, documentation  
**Organizations:** Solaris Academy, independent researchers

Scholars from across Aevoria come to study the Dominion. They map the ruins, catalog the relics, and try to piece together what happened. Since Eclipse Day, their work has become more urgent.

Leading theories include:
- A magical cataclysm sank a coastal empire
- A volcanic eruption destroyed an island civilization
- The Dominion was never on land at all
- The ruins aren't buildings but something else entirely

None of these theories fully explain the evidence.

### The Druids

**Philosophy:** See the Dominion as a wound in the world  
**Methods:** Observation, ritual, protection  
**Concerns:** 
Druidic tide-watchers believe the Dominion is unnatural. They claim the sea rejects it, that it shouldn't be there. Since Eclipse Day, they've been performing rituals to "calm the waters," but nothing seems to work.

### The Cults

**Philosophy:** See the Dominion as a sleeping god  
**Methods:** Worship, sacrifice, communion  
**Danger Level:** Extreme

Multiple cults have formed around the Dominion, each with different interpretations. Some worship the sea itself. Others believe ancient beings sleep in the deep. A few claim to hear voices from the ruins.

Since Eclipse Day, cult activity has intensified. Ritual sites have appeared along the coast. Disappearances have increased. Authorities struggle to keep up.

### Vharoxis

**Philosophy:** See the Dominion as profit  
**Methods:** Smuggling, black-market sales, information brokering  
**Impact:** Relics spread across the world

Vharoxis has established extensive smuggling networks for Dominion relics. They move artifacts to collectors, researchers, and anyone willing to pay. No questions asked. No records kept.

Their involvement has complicated every attempt to regulate salvage operations.

## Eclipse Day in the Sunken Dominion

Eclipse Day triggered unprecedented activity in the Dominion.


### **What Happened:**
- Glowing currents rose from the trenches, visible from shore
- A deep, resonant pulse felt by every diver in the water
- Sea creatures migrated in coordinated patterns toward the ruins
- A massive whirlpool formed above the Drowned Gate
- The Glassspire Ruins lit up simultaneously for exactly three minutes
- The water temperature dropped by fifteen degrees, then returned to normal

### **The Aftermath:**
- Every compass within fifty miles stopped working for a day
- Tidal patterns became erratic and remain unpredictable
- The glowing currents have persisted, growing brighter
- More relics than ever are washing ashore
- Fish catches include creatures never seen before
- Strange sounds echo from the deep

Sailors call it **The Day the Sea Woke**.

Since then, diving operations have become more dangerous. The ruins themselves seem more active. And the Drowned Gate's symbols now glow every night.

## Relations with Other Regions

### Shattered Coast
**Relationship:** Directly connected  
**Impact:** Most relics wash ashore along the Shattered Coast, disrupting trade and creating new dangers. Coastal settlements deal with strange washed-up creatures and glowing debris.

### Solaris Dominion
**Relationship:** Academic obsession  
**Impact:** Solaris scholars are consumed by the Dominion's mysteries. Multiple research expeditions have been funded. Political factions debate whether to claim the ruins or seal them away.

### Vharoxis
**Relationship:** Profitable exploitation  
**Impact:** Vharoxis smuggles relics from the Dominion to the highest bidder. They have agents in every coastal settlement, buying artifacts and bribing officials.

### Verdant Marches
**Relationship:** Druidic concern  
**Impact:** Druids believe the Dominion's awakening is tied to the land's stirring. They see it as part of a larger pattern of unnatural magic spreading across the world.

### The Far North
**Relationship:** Mysterious connection  
**Impact:** The Dominion's deepest structures share architectural patterns with northern megastructures. Scholars note similarities that shouldn't exist between ruins separated by thousands of miles.
