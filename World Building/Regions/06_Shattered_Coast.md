# THE SHATTERED COAST 

Maritime Frontier of Wrecks & Whispers

::**Theme:** Shipwrecks, maritime trade, artifact trafficking  
::**Tone:** Treacherous, mysterious, profitable  

---

## Summary

The Shattered Coast is a treacherous stretch of shoreline along Aevoria's western edge, where jagged reefs, unpredictable tides, and storm-torn cliffs have claimed countless ships. Sailors say the coast is cursed — that the sea itself hungers for vessels, dragging them into the depths to join the graveyard of wrecks below.

Despite the danger, the region is a bustling hub of:
- maritime trade  
- smuggling routes  
- salvage operations  
- pirate activity  
- coastal settlements clinging to survival  

The Shattered Coast is the lifeline between Solaris, Vharoxis, and the northern seas. It is also the place where strange things wash ashore — glowing stones, humming metal fragments, and creatures touched by the Aeorian Echo.

Most people avoid the deeper waters.  
Those who don't rarely return.

## Geography & Climate

The Shattered Coast spans hundreds of miles of rugged shoreline.

### Key Features

**The Razor Reefs**  
A maze of stone spires just beneath the waves. These jagged formations have shredded countless hulls. Navigating them requires local knowledge — or luck.  
**Stormfall Cliffs**  
Towering cliffs battered by constant storms. The cliffs are home to seabird colonies and hidden smuggler caves. Legends speak of ancient fortresses carved into the rock face.  
**The Drowned Forest**  
A coastal woodland half-submerged by rising tides. Dead trees stand like skeletal sentinels in the shallows. Strange lights are sometimes seen flickering between the trunks at night.  
**The Gravewater Trench**    
A deep ocean rift filled with shipwrecks. Divers speak of impossible structures far below — geometric shapes that don't match any known architecture.  
**The Lantern Isles**  
Scattered islands used by smugglers and pirates. Each island has its own reputation: some are safe havens, others are death traps.

### Climate

The climate is stormy year-round, with violent squalls that appear without warning. Sailors claim the storms follow no natural pattern — as if the weather itself is unpredictable by design.

## Major Settlements

### 1. Breakwater Haven

A fortified port town built atop an ancient breakwater.  
**Known for:**
- Master shipwrights who can repair any vessel  
- Salvage guilds that organize deep-water expeditions  
- Storm-priests who offer blessings for safe passage  
- A thriving black-market dockside where anything can be bought  

Breakwater Haven is the safest place to resupply — and the most dangerous place to ask the wrong questions.  
**Population:** ~2,500  
**Government:** Council of Harbor Masters  
**Defenses:** Stone walls, harbor chain, militia

### 2. Tide's Rest

A fishing village perched on stilts above the shallows.  
**Known for:**
- Reclusive druids who commune with the sea  
- Eerie tide-chants sung at dawn and dusk  
- Uncanny ability to predict storms days in advance  

Locals claim the sea "speaks" to them. Outsiders aren't sure whether to believe them — but the village has never lost a boat to unexpected weather.  
**Population:** ~400  
**Government:** Elder Circle  
**Atmosphere:** Isolated, spiritual, wary of outsiders

### 3. Corsair's Refuge

A hidden pirate port used by the Blackwake Corsairs of Vharoxis.  
**Known for:**
- Complete lawlessness outside Corsair-enforced rules  
- Ship refits and repairs at competitive prices  
- Smuggled relics and contraband from across the world  
- Taverns where sailors gamble with secrets instead of coin  

The Refuge is the beating heart of the coast's criminal underbelly. If you need something illegal, dangerous, or forbidden — this is where you find it.  
**Population:** ~800 (fluctuates with ship traffic)  
**Government:** Captain's Council (Corsair leadership)  
**Entry:** Invitation only or Corsair escort required

## Culture & Society

Life on the Shattered Coast is shaped by three forces:

### 1. The Sea

Unpredictable, dangerous, revered. Coastal folk treat the ocean like a living god — sometimes benevolent, often wrathful, always to be respected.

**Traditions:**
- Offerings cast into the waves before voyages  
- Superstitions about colors, directions, and words  
- Funeral rites that return bodies to the sea  
- Storm-prayers chanted during bad weather  

### 2. Storms

Storm-priests and tide-seers hold real influence in coastal communities. Their rituals are part weather-magic, part superstition — and they work often enough to command respect.

**Storm-Priest Abilities:**
- Weather prediction (uncannily accurate)  
- Wind-calling (limited control)  
- Blessing ships for safe passage  
- Reading omens in cloud patterns  

### 3. Wrecks

Salvage is a way of life. Every storm brings new opportunities — and new horrors. Salvagers walk the line between fortune-hunters and grave robbers.

**Salvage Rights:**
- First finder has primary claim  
- Dangerous wrecks can be claimed by guild teams  
- Artifact finds are heavily contested  
- Some wrecks are marked "cursed" and forbidden

## Magic

Coastal magic is primal and fluid:

### Stormcalling

Manipulating wind and weather. Coastal spellcasters specialize in:
- Summoning favorable winds  
- Calming storms (temporarily)  
- Creating fog banks for concealment  
- Calling lightning during battles  

### Tide-Reading

Predicting and understanding ocean patterns. This magic includes:
- Forecasting tides and currents  
- Finding safe passages through reefs  
- Sensing underwater dangers  
- Locating shipwrecks  

### Water Shaping

Manipulating water itself:
- Creating air bubbles for underwater breathing  
- Parting waves to reveal hidden passages  
- Solidifying water into temporary platforms  
- Directing currents to move vessels  

### Wind-Binding

Capturing wind in sails, bottles, or enchanted objects:
- Creating permanent favorable winds for trade routes  
- Storing emergency gusts in bottles  
- Binding air elementals to ship figureheads  
- Crafting wind-powered mechanisms  

**Note:** Coastal magic is less refined than Solaris magic, but more instinctive and adaptable.

## Eclipse Day on the Shattered Coast

The Eclipse triggered unprecedented events along the coast:

### Immediate Effects

**A massive tidal surge**  
Far larger than any natural tide, the wave struck without warning. Coastal settlements were flooded. Ships were lifted and deposited inland.

**Glowing currents visible beneath the waves**  
Bioluminescent patterns appeared in the water, forming geometric shapes. The patterns pulsed in rhythm, as if transmitting information.

**Strange lights rising from the Gravewater Trench**  
Deep underwater, something illuminated. Divers reported seeing vast structures glowing far below — too deep to reach, too large to comprehend.

**A shipwreck that washed ashore with no crew**  
The vessel was intact but empty. The cargo holds contained humming metal fragments. The crew's personal effects remained, but not a single body was found.

### Interpretation

Storm-priests declared it a **"Turning Tide"** — a sign that the sea's slumber is ending. They warn that the ocean is awakening to something ancient beneath the waves.

Sailors are divided:
- Some see it as an omen of doom  
- Others view it as opportunity for salvage  
- A few whisper that the sea is "remembering" something it had forgotten
