# The Shattered Coast — The Maritime Frontier

**Theme:** Shipwrecks, storms, drowned ruins  
**Tone:** Treacherous, mysterious  
**Role in the World:** Trade routes disrupted; artifact fragments wash ashore

---

## Overview

The Shattered Coast is a treacherous stretch of shoreline where the sea refuses to be tamed. Once a thriving maritime trade route, it has become increasingly dangerous since Eclipse Day—vessels lost to sudden storms, currents flowing in impossible directions, and strange lights beneath the waves luring ships to their doom.

The coastal settlements that survive here are tough, practical, and increasingly desperate. Fishing fleets return with empty nets or strange catches. Trade caravans arrive late or not at all. And every high tide brings something new washing ashore—sometimes treasures from sunken ships, sometimes fragments of ruins that shouldn't exist, and sometimes things that still move.

The Blackwake Corsairs operate here, using the chaos to profit from smuggling and salvage. But even they're growing worried. The sea itself seems to be waking up, and what sleeps beneath it might be better left undisturbed.

### Growing Tensions

**Traditional vs. Practical:**
- Old sailors: respect the sea, leave unknowns alone
- Young salvagers: profit from anything
- Elders warning of consequences
- Youth dismissing as superstition
- Both sides increasingly worried
- But: survival requires risks

**Local vs. Outsider:**
- Foreign ships bringing trouble
- Outsiders don't respect traditions
- But: locals need trade
- Corsairs exploiting everything
- Scholars asking too many questions

## The Aeorian Echo on the Coast

### Underwater Awakening

**What's Actually Happening:**
The Sunken Dominion—ancient Aeorian facilities submerged in cataclysm—is reactivating. Energy pulses affecting ocean:
- Currents disrupted by underwater power flows
- Storms generated by magical interference
- Marine life displaced or transformed
- Constructs stirring in depths
- Artifacts breaking free from sediment
- Structures rising from seafloor (slowly)


**Observable Effects:**

**Maritime Hazards:**
- Ships' compasses spinning
- Navigation spells failing
- Sudden whirlpools
- Water temperature shifts
- Phosphorescent trails (energy discharge)
- Sounds from deep (machinery waking)

**Biological Changes:**
- Fish swimming wrong directions
- Dead zones appearing
- Bioluminescence spreading
- Some creatures showing intelligence
- Aggressive behaviors (territorial? protective?)
- Mass migrations

**Physical Evidence:**
- Fragments washing ashore daily
- Geometric "rocks" (actually metal)
- Crystalline formations
- Inscribed tablets (unknown language)
- Mechanical pieces
- Things that hum or glow

**Disappearances:**
- Ships vanish without trace
- Divers don't surface
- Entire catches gone from holds
- Salvagers go missing
- Some return changed (quiet, distant)
- Won't speak of what they saw

### Eclipse Day Impact

**The Event:**
- Massive wave struck entire coast
- Not tidal wave: wrong physics
- Water glowed briefly
- Underwater sounds (loud, mechanical)
- Several ships capsized
- Dozens drowned

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- Rescue operations
- Damage assessment
- Survivors telling impossible stories
- Things seen underwater
- Lights and structures
- Sounds like speech


**Ongoing Consequences:**
- Increased anomalies
- More artifacts appearing
- Fishing becoming impossible in areas
- Trade routes shifting inland
- Some settlements evacuating
- Others fortifying

**Current Situation:**
- Three camps emerging:
  1. **Abandon the coast** (safety first)
  2. **Investigate and adapt** (understand threat)
  3. **Profit from chaos** (opportunists)
- No consensus
- Situation worsening
- Decision point approaching

## The Blackwake Corsairs

### Their Role
Dominant maritime force on the coast:

**Operations:**
- Smuggling (primary business)
- Piracy (selective targets)
- Salvage (organized fleets)
- Protection rackets (pay or sink)
- Information brokerage (who's shipping what)

**Resources:**
- Dozens of ships (fast, armed)
- Safe harbors (hidden)
- Network of informants
- Weather mages (forecasting, some control)
- Experienced sailors

**Leadership:**
- Captain Mara Bloodtide (overall commander)
- Fleet captains (autonomous operations)
- Shore agents (Port Salvage primarily)
- Vharoxis connections (smuggling)

**Post-Eclipse Day:**
Even corsairs worried:
- Lost ships to anomalies
- Sailors refusing assignments
- Underwater routes dangerous
- But: salvage extremely profitable
- Artifact trafficking booming
- Divided between profit and survival


### Corsair Operations



**Smuggling Networks:**
- Move illegal goods worldwide
- Artifact trafficking (major growth)
- Bypass tariffs and blockades
- Connect Vharoxis to everywhere
- Know all hidden routes
- Adapting to changing conditions

**Salvage Operations:**
- Organized diving teams
- Magical underwater breathing
- Mapping seafloor (what they can)
- Recovering artifacts (selling to Vharoxis)
- Some disappearances (dangers)
- Growing reluctance

**Piracy:**
- Selective targets (profitable, weak)
- Avoid military vessels (usually)
- Rob Solarian merchants (favorite)
- Let survivors talk (reputation)
- Since Eclipse: more cautious
- Sea itself now enemy

### Internal Debate

**Traditionalist Corsairs:**
"The sea is turning against us. Respect it or die."
- Want to reduce operations
- Stop artifact salvage
- Ancient sites should remain undisturbed
- Profit not worth lives
- Led by older captains

**Opportunist Corsairs:**
"Fortune favors the bold. Adapt or starve."
- Increase salvage operations
- Artifacts incredibly valuable
- Monopolize new market
- Technology might protect us
- Led by younger captains

**Captain Bloodtide's Position:**
- Trying to balance factions
- Personally: worried but pragmatic
- Knows something big happening
- Seeking information and solutions
- Might work with party if properly approached
- Price: always a price

*"The sea is waking up. And it's not waking up natural. Something down there is stirring, and it remembers when the surface was its domain."*

— Captain Mara Bloodtide, to her fleet
