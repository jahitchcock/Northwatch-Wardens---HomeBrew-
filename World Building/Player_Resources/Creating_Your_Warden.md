# Creating Your Warden

*A guide to bringing your adventurer to life in the Northwatch Wardens campaign*

{{descriptive
Welcome to the frontier. You've come to Northreach for your own reasons—seeking opportunity, fleeing trouble, or answering a call to adventure. The Northwatch Wardens accept capable individuals regardless of their past. What matters is what you can do now, and whether you're willing to stand with others when the cold winds blow.

## Before You Begin

This campaign emphasizes:
- **Investigation and exploration** over constant combat
- **Moral complexity** — not every problem has a clear solution
- **Community impact** — your choices affect settlements and people
- **Survival and resourcefulness** — the frontier is unforgiving
- **Drop-in flexibility** — characters can come and go between sessions

Consider these themes when imagining your Warden.

## Step One: Your Concept

Start with who your character is, not just what they can do.

### The Three Questions

Answer these to ground your character in Northreach:

**1. Why did you come to the frontier?**
- Escaping something in the south (debt, scandal, war, family)
- Seeking fortune in a land of opportunity
- Following someone (friend, mentor, loved one)
- Driven by curiosity about the region's mysteries
- Answering a call for help from the Wardens

**2. What skills did you bring with you?**
- Combat training (guard, soldier, mercenary)
- Wilderness expertise (hunter, trapper, guide)
- Scholarly knowledge (researcher, mage, healer)
- Social finesse (diplomat, merchant, performer)
- Practical trades (smith, carpenter, herbalist)

**3. What keeps you with the Wardens?**
- The pay and regular work
- Protecting vulnerable communities
- Investigating the strange phenomena
- Brotherhood with other Wardens
- Nowhere else to go

## Step Two: Building Your Mechanics

### Determining Your Capabilities

Work with your DM to establish your character's statistics. Common methods include:

- **Standard Array**: Assign 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 to your six abilities
- **Point Distribution**: Allocate 27 points across abilities (detailed by your DM)
- **Rolling Fortunes**: Roll dice as directed by your DM

Choose the method your table prefers. The frontier doesn't care how you got strong or clever—only that you are.

### Prioritizing for the Campaign

Given Northwatch Wardens' investigative focus, consider these priorities:

**For Front-Line Protectors:**
- Physical resilience (Constitution)
- Combat effectiveness (Strength or Dexterity)
- Intimidation or inspiration (Charisma)

**For Wilderness Specialists:**
- Awareness (Wisdom)
- Endurance (Constitution)
- Agility (Dexterity)

**For Investigators:**
- Mental acuity (Intelligence or Wisdom)
- Social graces (Charisma)
- Physical stamina (Constitution)

**For Support Roles:**
- Magical aptitude (varies by tradition)
- Healing capacity (Wisdom)
- Party awareness (Wisdom or Intelligence)

## Step Three: Heritage and Homeland

### Species Common to Northreach

The frontier draws folk from across Aevoria. Here's who you'll find in Northreach:

**Humans** — Most numerous; adaptable frontier settlers from the Solaris Dominion and beyond. They bring diverse skills and ambitions.

**Dwarves** — Sturdy folk from the Stonebound Depths, skilled in stonecraft and metallurgy. Some seek fortune in Northreach's untapped mineral wealth.

**Elves** — Refugees from the Nullwood Expanse or wanderers seeking escape from their people's rigid memory-curation. Long-lived perspective valuable for understanding ancient threats.

\column

**Halflings** — Practical and community-minded, often running farms or inns. Welton's shepherd culture is predominantly halfling.

**Dragonborn** — Rare but present; some fled conflicts in the south. Their presence sometimes unsettles locals who remember dragon raids, but capable Dragonborn earn respect quickly.

**Other Heritages** — Half-elves, tieflings, and other folk find acceptance in Northreach. The frontier judges capability, not bloodlines.

### Cultural Background

Where did you come from before Northreach?

- **Solaris Dominion** — Urban sophistication meets frontier reality
- **Stonebound Depths** — Stone-sense and deep earth traditions
- **Nullwood Expanse** — Silence magic and memory-keeping
- **Vharoxis** — Street smarts and survival instincts
- **Shattered Coast** — Maritime skills and storm-reading
- **The Emberlands** — Fire-hardened and resilient
- **Verdant Marches** — Primal magic and beast-speaking
- **Rural Northreach** — Already adapted to frontier life
- **The Far North** — Ice-walker traditions and survival lore

Your homeland shapes how you approach problems and what you understand instinctively.

## Step Five: Life Before the Wardens

Your past shaped who you became. Consider these backgrounds:

### Soldier or Guard
You know discipline, combat formations, and military logistics. You understand chain of command but may chafe under strict authority—or crave its structure.

### Outlander or Hermit
The wilderness is your home. You know how to read weather, find food, and survive where others perish. Cities feel claustrophobic.

### Criminal or Charlatan
You learned hard lessons in dangerous places. Your skills aren't "proper," but they're effective. Northreach offers a chance to use them for something better—or just more profitable.

### Scholar or Sage
You studied in libraries or under masters. Your knowledge of history, arcana, or natural philosophy gives you context others lack. Now you seek practical application.

### Acolyte or Priest
Faith guides your path. Whether serving an established church or following personal revelation, you see meaning in the Wardens' mission.

\page

### Folk Hero or Noble
Your reputation preceded you—for better or worse. Some know your name, and that brings complications alongside respect.

### Artisan or Merchant
You mastered a trade: smithing, carpentry, alchemy, or commerce. The frontier needs builders as much as fighters.

### Entertainer or Charlatan
You understand people: their desires, fears, and stories. This makes you effective at negotiation—or manipulation.

### Custom Origins
Work with your DM to create something that fits your character's specific history. Maybe you're:
- A former researcher investigating Aeorian ruins
- A shepherd whose flock was killed by awakened predators
- A merchant whose caravan was destroyed by bandits
- A refugee from conflicts in the south
- A local who watched the frontier change mysteriously

\column

## Step Seven: Equipment and Resources

### Starting Wealth

Your DM will provide starting resources. Typical approaches:

- **Standard Issue**: Receive equipment based on your training and profession
- **Gold Allocation**: Purchase from available equipment lists
- **Background-Based**: Equipment reflecting your past (soldier gets military gear, merchant gets trade goods)

### Essential Frontier Gear

Beyond weapons and armor, seasoned Wardens carry:
- **Winter clothing** — Northreach winters are brutal
- **Rope (50 ft)** — Endless uses in exploration
- **Waterskin and rations** — Contracts take you far from settlements
- **Bedroll and tinderbox** — Wilderness survival basics
- **Light source** — Torch, lantern, or magic
- **Healer's supplies** — The guild provides basic medical support, but field treatment saves lives

### Guild Resources

Once accepted, you gain access to:
- **Waystone Inn lodging** — Bunk, hot meal, basic medical care
- **Guild quartermaster** — Mara Fenwick can provide or requisition standard supplies
- **Contract stipends** — Some missions provide specialized equipment
- **Guild library** — Lorewarden Elric maintains records and reference materials

---

## Step Eight: Personality and Motivation

### Defining Traits

Choose 2-3 traits that define how others perceive you:
- Direct and blunt, or diplomatic and careful?
- Optimistic about Northreach's future, or grimly realistic?
- Trust people until proven wrong, or suspect everyone?
- Methodical planner, or improvisational problem-solver?
- Lead naturally, or prefer following capable leadership?

### Bonds

What connects you to the world?
- A person you protect or seek
- A place you call home or hope to build
- An ideal you serve or principle you uphold
- An organization you belong to or oppose

\column

### Flaws

Everyone has weaknesses. Choose something that creates interesting challenges:
- A fear that sometimes paralyzes you
- A vice that offers temporary escape
- A prejudice you struggle against
- A secret that could ruin you
- A personality trait that alienates others
- A past mistake you can't forgive yourself for

### Guild Integration

Why do the Northwatch Wardens interest you?

**Idealists** believe in protecting the vulnerable and making the frontier safer. The work matters more than recognition.

**Pragmatists** see steady employment, fair pay, and mutual support. It's good work with decent people.

**Seekers** sense mysteries unfolding. Something strange is happening in Northreach, and the Wardens investigate rather than ignore.

**Survivors** need somewhere to belong. The guild accepts those who prove themselves, regardless of past.

**Exiles** can't return home. Northreach is far enough from wherever you're running.

Choose the motivation that resonates—or let it evolve through play.

## Step Nine: Your Warden's Story

### Character Arc Possibilities

Consider where your character might grow:

**From:** Inexperienced → **To:** Seasoned veteran
**From:** Distrustful loner → **To:** Loyal team member
**From:** Glory-seeker → **To:** Protector of the vulnerable
**From:** Haunted by past → **To:** Accepting and growing
**From:** Skeptic of magic → **To:** Understanding its necessity
**From:** Self-serving → **To:** Community-minded

Let the campaign shape your character organically.

### Secrets and Mysteries

Consider giving your character one secret—something only you and the DM know. This creates personal stakes:
- You're investigating someone's disappearance
- You're fleeing from someone or something
- You possess an item others would kill for
- You know something about the awakening magic
- You're connected to one of the guild leadership
- You have a personal stake in one of the settlements

Share this with your DM during character creation.

## Step Ten: Integration with the Party

### The Warden Bond

Once sworn in, you're not just allies—you're guild members with shared responsibilities. The Code binds you:

1. Protect the innocent
2. Honor your contracts
3. Share vital information with fellow Wardens
4. Respect the frontier's people, land, and traditions
5. Stand against corruption, mortal or magical
6. Never abandon a companion unless retreat is the only survival path

This provides in-character justification for party cohesion.

\column

### Party Roles

Consider what role you fill:
- **Combat specialist** — You handle direct threats
- **Scout** — You investigate ahead and spot danger
- **Face** — You handle social interactions
- **Support** — You keep others alive and effective
- **Specialist** — You handle specific challenges (locks, magic, healing)

No party needs every role, but understanding your contribution helps.

### Session Zero

Before play begins, discuss with your group:
- **Tone expectations** — Balance of serious vs. lighthearted
- **Content boundaries** — Topics to avoid or handle carefully
- **Attendance** — How drop-in play affects the story
- **Character connections** — Do you know each other beforehand?
- **Party balance** — Ensuring diverse capabilities

## Final Notes

### What You Don't Need

You don't need:
- A twenty-page backstory (one page is plenty)
- Optimization for maximum combat efficiency
- A tragic past to justify adventuring
- Connections to world-shaking events
- Permission to be a capable, interesting person

### What You Do Need

You do need:
- A reason to accept dangerous contracts
- Skills that contribute to party success
- Personality traits that create interesting interactions

### Remember

The Northwatch Wardens accept you for what you can do now, not who you were. The frontier doesn't care about your bloodline, your homeland, or your past failures. It only asks: when the wolves howl and the cold winds blow, will you stand with your fellow Wardens?

Welcome to Northreach. There's work to be done.
