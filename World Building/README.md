# World Building

This folder is the **setting bible** for Northwatch Wardens: Northreach (Season One) plus the wider “off-map” world.

It’s organized so you can keep **player-safe lore** separate from **DM-only truth**, while also keeping reusable world reference material separate from season/module content (which lives under [Season 1/](../Season%201/)).

---

## ⚠️ Player vs DM Content

### ✅ PLAYER-SAFE FOLDERS
All content in these folders is safe for players to read:
- `Regions/` — Regional lore and gazetteer entries
- `Organizations/` — Factions, guilds, and institutions
- `Locations/` — Canonical location descriptions
- `Religion/` — Pantheons and faiths
- `Campaign Assets/` — Maps and visual resources

### 🚫 DM-ONLY FOLDERS
**SPOILER WARNING:** These folders contain campaign secrets and plot reveals:
- `DMEyesOnly/` — **DO NOT SHARE WITH PLAYERS** - Contains the truth behind the setting, NPC secrets, and the Aeorian Echo mystery

## Table of Contents

### Player-Safe Lore

All content in World Building is safe for players, EXCEPT for files in [DMEyesOnly/](./DMEyesOnly/).

### DM Content (Spoilers)

- [DMEyesOnly/](./DMEyesOnly/) — The truth behind the setting: secrets, motivations, and the Aeorian Echo.

### World Reference (Reusable / Canon)

- [Locations/](./Locations/) — Canonical location sheets (often off-map from Northreach).
- [Regions/](./Regions/) — Macro-regions and “Known World” worldbook entries.
- [Organizations/](./Organizations/) — Factions and institutions.
	- Northwatch Wardens charter lives here: [Organizations/Northwatch_Wardens/](./Organizations/Northwatch_Wardens/)

## Relationship to Season 1

- **Adventures, encounters, and play materials:** [Season 1/Adventures/](../Season%201/Adventures/)
- **DM session tools + DM rosters:** [Season 1/DM_Resources/](../Season%201/DM_Resources/)

World Building is the **source of truth** for setting canon; Season 1 is where the campaign is run from.

---

## Northreach Canon Guardrails (Season One)

- Don’t invent new **Northreach** locations unless we explicitly decide to expand the Northreach map.
- Off-map world lore is welcome (use [Regions/](./Regions/) and [Locations/](./Locations/)); label it clearly as off-map when relevant.
