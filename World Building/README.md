## Campaign Integration

### The Aeorian Echo Plotline

The central threat of Northwatch Wardens Season One involves the reactivation of ancient Aeorian facilities scattered across the region. This conspiracy operates on multiple levels:

**What Players Know:**
- Strange occurrences are happening (wolves, illnesses, thefts)
- Something connects these events
- The region faces an escalating threat

**What the DM Knows:**
- A surviving Aeorian intelligence is systematically reactivating ancient weapons
- Multiple NPCs have hidden connections to this threat
- The players can discover the truth through investigation
- The campaign builds to confronting the source of the Echo

**Revelation Structure:**
1. **Early:** Local mysteries seem unconnected
2. **Mid:** Patterns emerge, Aeorian origin discovered
3. **Late:** Full scope revealed, final confrontation prepared
