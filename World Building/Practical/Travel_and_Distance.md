## Journey Planning for the Frontier

The frontier rewards preparation and punishes haste. Understanding travel times, seasonal conditions, and the costs of movement can mean the difference between a successful contract and a frozen corpse on the roadside.

## Travel Methods

### On Foot (Standard)

Most Wardens travel on foot—it's reliable, doesn't require feed, and allows for investigation along the route.

**Speeds by Terrain:**
- **Open Terrain** (roads, plains): 24 miles/day
- **Light Forest** (maintained trails): 18 miles/day
- **Dense Forest** (game trails): 12 miles/day
- **Mountains** (rugged paths): 12 miles/day
- **Swamp or Deep Snow**: 6 miles/day

**Carrying Capacity:** Standard PHB rules apply. Characters with 15+ Strength can maintain normal speed while carrying heavy loads; those with lower Strength should plan accordingly.

**Forced March:** Traveling more than 8 hours requires a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per hour beyond 8) or gain one level of exhaustion.

### Mounted Travel

Horses are expensive to maintain on the frontier but offer significant advantages.

**Riding Horse:**
- Speed: 30 miles/day (open), 24 miles/day (light forest)
- Cost: 75 gp to purchase, 3 gp/day to rent
- Feed: 5 sp/day (stable), forage possible in summer (Survival DC 12)
- Cannot navigate mountains or deep forest effectively

**Draft Horse (Wagon):**
- Speed: 15 miles/day on roads only
- Capacity: 540 lbs or 6 people
- Cost: 50 gp to purchase, 5 gp/day to rent with wagon
- Feed: 5 sp/day
- Roads required; impassable in rough terrain

**Warhorse:**
- Speed: Same as riding horse
- Combat-trained (doesn't panic)
- Cost: 400 gp to purchase, 8 gp/day to rent
- Rare in Northreach; usually owned by nobles or wealthy mercenaries

### Snowshoes and Winter Travel

Winter travel in Northreach requires specialized equipment.

**Snowshoes:**
- Cost: 2 gp
- Effect: Negates difficult terrain from snow (up to 2 feet deep)
- Speed: Normal walking speed in snow
- Without snowshoes: Snow counts as difficult terrain (half speed)

**Sleds:**
- Cost: 10 gp (small), 25 gp (large)
- Capacity: 300 lbs (small), 800 lbs (large)
- Requires 1 person (small) or 2 people + draft animal (large)
- Speed: 12 miles/day in snow

---

## Seasonal Conditions

Northreach's harsh seasons dramatically affect travel. Plan accordingly or risk death.

### Spring (Thaw Moon to Planting Moon)

**Conditions:** Muddy roads, swollen rivers, unpredictable weather  
**Temperature:** 35-55°F during day, freezing at night  
**Travel Impact:** Roads become difficult terrain; river crossings dangerous

**Effects:**
- Wagon travel reduced by 50% (mud)
- Athletics checks (DC 12) to cross swollen streams
- Random spring storms (10% chance/day)

**Advantages:**
- Game returns; foraging becomes possible (Survival DC 12)
- Fewer predators (many still denning)

\column

### Summer (Planting Moon to Harvest Moon)

**Conditions:** Mild, wet, occasionally hot  
**Temperature:** 55-75°F, rare nights below 45°F  
**Travel Impact:** Best season for travel

**Effects:**
- Normal travel speeds
- No cold weather survival checks
- Foraging easy (Survival DC 10)

**Challenges:**
- Insects (mostly annoyance)
- Thunderstorms (15% chance/day in late summer)
- Increased bandit activity on roads

{{note
##### Summer Travel Advantage

This is the only season where inexperienced travelers can reasonably survive Northreach roads. Most merchant caravans operate exclusively in summer months.
}}

### Autumn (Harvest Moon to First Snow)

**Conditions:** Cool, increasingly unpredictable, early snow possible  
**Temperature:** 40-60°F early autumn, 25-45°F late autumn  
**Travel Impact:** Deteriorating conditions; race against winter

**Effects:**
- Early autumn: Normal travel
- Late autumn (after first frost): Travel speeds reduced 25%
- Constitution saves (DC 10) for extended outdoor exposure in late autumn

**Challenges:**
- Weather changes rapidly
- Game migrates; foraging becomes difficult (Survival DC 15)
- Communities stockpiling; hospitality strained

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote TRAVEL AND DISTANCE IN NORTHREACH}}

\page

### Winter (First Snow to Thaw Moon)

**Conditions:** Lethal cold, deep snow, blizzards  
**Temperature:** -10°F to 30°F, windchill often -20°F or lower  
**Travel Impact:** Extremely dangerous; avoid unless absolutely necessary

{{descriptive
"Winter doesn't care about your courage, your mission, or your god. It just kills. Respect it or join the frozen."

—Marshal Brenna Thorne
}}

**Survival Requirements:**

**Cold Weather Outfit** (mandatory)
- Cost: 10 gp
- Effect: Grants advantage on Constitution saves against cold
- Without it: Automatic failure on survival checks

**Shelter** (required nightly)
- Tent/lean-to: Constitution save DC 10 to avoid exhaustion
- Building with fire: No save required
- No shelter: Constitution save DC 15 to avoid exhaustion, disadvantage without cold weather outfit

**Daily Survival Checks:**
Traveling in winter requires a Constitution saving throw at the end of each day:
- **DC 10** with shelter and fire
- **DC 15** with shelter, no fire
- **DC 20** without shelter (automatic failure without cold weather outfit)

**Failure:** Gain one level of exhaustion

- Visibility reduced to 30 feet
- All terrain is difficult terrain
- Constitution save DC 18 to avoid exhaustion
- Impossible to forage or hunt
- High risk of getting lost (Survival DC 18 to navigate)

\column

**Winter Travel Speeds:**
- Snow depth 1-2 feet: Half speed (snowshoes negate)
- Snow depth 3+ feet: Quarter speed (snowshoes reduce to half speed)
- During blizzard: Travel not recommended

{{note
##### Winter Death Toll

Every winter, 10-20 travelers die on Northreach roads. Locals know: if you can delay until spring, do so. If you cannot, travel with experienced guides, bring twice the supplies you think you need, and write your will before you leave.
}}

**Winter Equipment Checklist:**
- ✓ Cold weather outfit (10 gp)
- ✓ Snowshoes (2 gp)
- ✓ Winter tent or bedroll rated for cold (25 gp)
- ✓ Tinderbox and extra kindling (2 gp)

## Navigation and Getting Lost

### Staying on Course

Travel on established roads rarely requires navigation checks. Wilderness travel is another matter.

**Navigation Check (Survival):**
- **Well-Marked Trail:** No check required
- **Game Trail or Rough Direction:** DC 10
- **Trackless Wilderness:** DC 15
- **Poor Visibility (fog, storm, night):** DC 20

**Failure:** Party travels in wrong direction for 1d6 hours before realizing error. This can add hours or days to journey time.

**Tools:**
- **Navigator's Tools:** Grants advantage on navigation checks
- **Compass:** +2 to navigation checks
- **Accurate Map:** +2 to navigation checks (DM discretion on map quality)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote TRAVEL AND DISTANCE IN NORTHREACH}}

\page

### Landmarks and Wayfinding

Experienced travelers use natural and artificial landmarks:

**Natural Landmarks:**
- **North Star (clear nights):** Provides automatic directional sense
- **Moss growth:** Unreliable (DC 20 Survival to use effectively)
- **Prevailing winds:** DC 15 Survival to interpret
- **Animal trails:** Often lead to water, but not always to safety

**Artificial Landmarks:**
- **Cairns (stone markers):** Indicate traveled routes
- **Blazed trees:** Trail markers cut into bark
- **Road stones:** Placed every mile on major roads
- **Distant smoke:** Settlements or camps (investigate cautiously)

{{note
##### Lorewarden's Library Maps

The Waystone Inn maintains maps of known routes and dangers. Wardens can copy these maps before departing (1 hour work, cartographer's tools). Lorewarden Elric Vael personally updates them based on field reports.
}}

## Terrain Types and Hazards

### Open Terrain (Plains, Roads)

**Travel Speed:** 24 miles/day on foot, 30 miles/day mounted  
**Navigation:** Easy (DC 10 or no check on roads)  
**Cover:** Minimal; difficult to hide or ambush  
**Hazards:** Exposure to weather, visible to threats from distance

**Recommended For:** Rapid travel between settlements, wagon transport

\column

### Forest (Light)

**Travel Speed:** 18 miles/day on foot, 24 miles/day mounted  
**Navigation:** Moderate (DC 12)  
**Cover:** Good for stealth and ambush  
**Hazards:** Wild animals, bandits, limited visibility

**Recommended For:** Avoiding attention, hunting, foraging

### Forest (Dense)

**Travel Speed:** 12 miles/day on foot, mounted not recommended  
**Navigation:** Difficult (DC 15)  
**Cover:** Excellent but limits movement  
**Hazards:** Disorientation, predators, difficult to get help

**Avoid Unless:** Investigating specific locations, tracking quarry, hiding from pursuit

### Mountains

**Travel Speed:** 12 miles/day on foot, mounted very difficult  
**Navigation:** Difficult (DC 15-20)  
**Cover:** Varies; exposure on ridges, shelter in valleys  
**Hazards:** Cliffs, rockslides, altitude, extreme weather, limited resources

**Special Considerations:**

**Suitable Camp Locations:**

**Good Camps (Long Rest succeeds automatically):**
- Wayfarer shelters (stone huts along major roads)
- Abandoned buildings (if safe)
- Deep forest groves (concealed)
- Mountain caves (checked for occupants)

**Poor Camps (Constitution DC 10 or gain exhaustion):**
- Exposed roadside
- Wet or marshy ground
- Windy hilltops
- Areas with recent predator signs

**Dangerous Camps (Constitution DC 15 or gain exhaustion):**
- No shelter during storm
- Extremely cold without fire
- Haunted or corrupted locations
- Active monster territory

{{note
##### Wayfarer Shelters

Stone shelters exist along major Northreach roads, spaced roughly one day's travel apart. These simple structures provide protection from weather and are maintained by local communities. Always check for occupants (human or otherwise) before settling in.
}}

\column

### Watch Duty

Someone must watch for danger during long rests in the wilderness.

**Watch Rotation (4-person party):**
- 1st Watch (dusk): 2 hours
- 2nd Watch (early night): 2 hours
- 3rd Watch (midnight): 2 hours
- 4th Watch (pre-dawn): 2 hours

**Watch Duties:**
- Perception checks to detect threats (DC varies)
- Maintain fire if present
- Wake party if danger approaches
- Note unusual sounds or sights

**Sleeping in Armor:**
- Light armor: No penalty
- Medium armor: No Long Rest benefit (counts as Light Activity)
- Heavy armor: Cannot gain Long Rest benefits

{{descriptive
"First watch is when you're fresh and alert. Second watch is when you're fighting sleep. Third watch is when you think you hear everything. Fourth watch—that's when things actually happen. Stay sharp on fourth."

—Bordel Barleywind, veteran Trailwarden

## Foraging and Hunting

Feeding a party on the road reduces supply costs but takes time and skill.

### Foraging for Food

**Time Required:** 1 hour (conducted during travel, slows party by 1 hour)  
**Skill Check:** Survival  
**DC by Season:**
- Spring: DC 14 (scarce, new growth)
- Summer: DC 10 (abundant)
- Autumn: DC 12 (harvest but dwindling)
- Winter: DC 20 (nearly impossible)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote TRAVEL AND DISTANCE IN NORTHREACH}}

\page

**Success:** Find 1d6 pounds of edible plants, berries, roots, or mushrooms (1 pound = 1 day's food for one person)

**Terrain Modifiers:**
- Forest: +0
- Plains/Open: +2 to DC
- Mountains: +5 to DC
- Coastal: -2 to DC (shellfish, seaweed)

{{note
##### Herbalism Kit

Characters with herbalism kit proficiency can attempt to find medicinal plants while foraging. Separate Survival check (DC 15) yields 1d4 herbs suitable for crafting healing supplies.
}}

### Hunting

**Time Required:** 4 hours minimum (half-day activity)  
**Skill Check:** Survival (tracking) then attack rolls (combat)  
**DC by Season:**
- Spring/Summer: DC 12 (game abundant)
- Autumn: DC 10 (game fattening for winter)
- Winter: DC 18 (scarce, desperate)

**Success:** Encounter game appropriate to terrain
- **Rabbits/Small Game:** 1d4 pounds meat
- **Deer/Medium Game:** 3d6 pounds meat
- **Elk/Large Game:** 6d6 pounds meat

**Processing Game:**
- Requires 1 hour + Survival check DC 10
- Failure wastes 50% of meat
- Success preserves all meat
- Preserved meat lasts 1 week in cool weather, 3 days in warm weather

**Hunting Risks:**
- Attracts predators (scent of blood)
- Loud (gunshots or combat alert nearby creatures)
- Time-consuming (party must stop for hours)
