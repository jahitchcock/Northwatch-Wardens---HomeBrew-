# Currency and Trade in Northreach


## Overview

In Northreach, money flows as slowly as news travels. The frontier economy runs on practical needs: food, tools, shelter, and protection. Gold matters, but reputation and relationships often matter more.

---

## Standard Currency

### The Five Coins

Northreach uses the standard coinage found throughout the known world:

- **Copper Pieces (cp):** The worker's coin. Most daily transactions.
- **Silver Pieces (sp):** Common currency. Fair wages and modest goods.
- **Electrum Pieces (ep):** Rare in Northreach. Mistrusted by some.
- **Gold Pieces (gp):** Serious money. Major purchases and contracts.
- **Platinum Pieces (pp):** Almost never seen. Merchant caravans and wealthy travelers.

### Exchange Rates

Standard rates apply:
- 10 copper = 1 silver
- 2 electrum = 1 gold
- 10 silver = 1 gold
- 10 gold = 1 platinum

### What Money Looks Like Here

**Worn and Mixed:**
- Coins from many kingdoms circulate
- Age and wear common (no mints nearby)
- Value by metal content, not whose face is stamped on it
- Clipped or shaved coins viewed with suspicion

**Local Preferences:**
- Silver most common for daily business
- Gold saved for emergencies or major purchases
- Copper used for smallest transactions
- Platinum might sit in a merchant's strongbox for years

## Barter and Alternative Currency

### When Coin Isn't Enough

In Northreach, pure currency transactions are often impractical:

**Common Reasons to Barter:**
- Lack of sufficient coinage
- Need to preserve cash reserves for winter
- Building relationships and obligations
- Items more useful than money in isolation
- Emergency situations where goodwill matters

### What Trades Well

**High-Value Barter Goods:**
- Quality tools (always needed)
- Preserved food (winter insurance)
- Warm clothing and blankets
- Ammunition and weapon maintenance
- Healing supplies
- Salt (preservation essential)
- Seeds (next year's crop)

**Service Barter:**
- Labor exchange (help with barn-raising, harvesting)
- Skill sharing (teach a trade, share knowledge)
- Future obligations (recorded and remembered)
- Protection and escort services
- Information and warnings

### Barter Etiquette

**Fair Exchange:**
- Both parties should feel satisfied
- Consider future value and scarcity
- Account for quality and condition
- Factor in urgency and need

**Recording Trades:**

- Written records for complex exchanges
- Community memory for smaller trades
- Breaking barter agreements damages reputation

\column

### Credit and Debt

**How Credit Works:**

- Witnessed by community members
- Written for significant amounts
- Interest rarely charged among locals
- Expected repayment timeline agreed upon

**Consequences of Default:**

- Possible loss of property
- Forced labor to settle debt

### The Favor Economy

**Favors as Currency:**
- Helping neighbors creates obligations
- Remembered for years or generations
- Repaid when able
- Refusing reasonable request damages standing

**Examples:**
- "I helped build your barn; you'll help with mine"
- "Your father saved my life; I owe your family"
- "You warned us about the wolves; we'll remember"
