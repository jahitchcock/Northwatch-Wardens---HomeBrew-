## The Economics of the Frontier

Northreach operates on a practical economy. Goods are priced based on scarcity, transport costs, and immediate usefulness. What costs coppers in Solaris might cost gold pieces here—and what seems expensive in the south might be worthless on the frontier.

{{descriptive
"Everything costs more up north, except land and trouble. Those are free."

—Common saying among Northreach merchants

## Understanding Frontier Pricing

### The Frontier Surcharge

Most manufactured goods cost **1.5× standard PHB prices** in Northreach settlements due to:
- Long supply lines from the south
- Dangerous transport routes
- Limited local production
- Seasonal scarcity (especially winter)

**Exceptions:**
- Basic rations and local produce (no surcharge)
- Services provided by locals (standard rates)
- Goods the Wardens provide to members (see Guild Benefits)

### Seasonal Price Fluctuations

**Spring (Thaw to Planting):**
- Food: Standard prices
- Healing supplies: +25% (winter depleted stocks)
- Transport: -25% (caravans resume)

**Summer (Planting to Harvest):**
- Food: -10% (fresh produce)
- All goods: Standard frontier pricing
- Transport: Widely available

**Autumn (Harvest to First Snow):**
- Food: -20% (harvest surplus)
- Winter gear: +50% (demand increases)
- Transport: +25% (last caravans)

**Winter (First Snow to Thaw):**
- Food: +50% (stored goods only)
- Healing potions: +100% (scarce, life-saving)
- Transport: Not available
- Firewood: 5× normal price

## Merchant Price Negotiation

### Haggling in Northreach

Frontier merchants expect negotiation, but the margin is thin. Success requires both skill and respect.

**Persuasion Check Results:**

| Check Result | Price Adjustment |
|:-------------|:-----------------|
| 5 or lower | Merchant offended; +10% markup |
| 6-10 | No change; merchant holds firm |
| 11-15 | 5% discount on total purchase |
| 16-20 | 10% discount on total purchase |
| 21-25 | 15% discount + future favor |
| 26+ | 20% discount + merchant becomes contact |

**Modifiers:**
- **Bulk purchase (50+ gp):** +2 to check
- **Repeat customer:** +2 to check
- **Guild member:** +1 to check
- **Poor reputation:** -2 to check
- **Attempting to haggle necessities during winter:** -5 to check (bad form)

**Cultural Notes:**
- Haggling is expected for major purchases (weapons, armor, tools)
- Haggling for food or basic supplies is considered rude
- Never haggle with healers during emergencies
- Always haggle with merchants from Vharoxis (they expect it)

## Special Considerations

### Seasonal Scarcity

**Items Always Available:**
- Basic food (bread, preserved rations)
- Common clothing
- Simple tools
- Firewood (expensive in winter)
- Basic weapons (axes, spears, bows)

**Items Seasonally Scarce:**
- Fresh produce (winter)
- Healing potions (winter, after major incidents)
- Complex repairs (winter - smiths focus on essential work)
- Mounts (winter - too dangerous to travel)
- Luxury goods (always scarce, worse in winter)

**Items Nearly Impossible to Find:**
- Plate armor (must commission from south)
- Magic items (except potions)
- Exotic spell components
- Fine wines and delicacies
- Books and scrolls (except Elric's library)

## Emergency Prices

When supplies are critically low or danger is immediate, prices skyrocket:

**Crisis Pricing (Blizzard, Siege, Disaster):**
- Basic rations: 5× normal
- Healing: 3× normal
- Firewood: 10× normal
- Shelter: 5× normal
- Ammunition: 3× normal

**Price Gouging:**
- Considered deeply dishonorable in Northreach
- Communities remember and shun those who exploit crises
- Wardens investigate and may intervene
- Marshal Brenna has been known to "requisition" hoarded supplies during emergencies
