## For Players

### Your First Session

If you're new to the campaign, start here:

1. **Read the Charter** — The Northwatch Wardens operate by a code. Familiarize yourself with [The Northwatch Wardens Charter](../Organizations/Northwatch_Wardens/THE%20NORTHWATCH%20WARDENS%20-%20Charter.md) to understand what it means to be a Warden.

2. **Learn About Northreach** — Your adventures begin in the cold frontier. The [Northreach Setting Primer](../Regions/Northreach/Northreach_Setting_Primer.md) gives you everything you need to know in one page.

3. **Choose or Create a Character** — You can use one of the pre-made characters from the `Premade PCs/` folder, or create your own using standard D&D 5e rules.

4. **Arrive at the Waystone Inn** — Your adventure begins at the guild headquarters, where contracts are posted and Wardens gather.

{{note
##### First-Time Players
Don't worry about reading everything before your first session. The most important thing is to understand your character and the guild's basic code. Your DM will introduce the world as you explore it.
}}

### Between Sessions

Keep your adventure alive between game nights:

- **Update Your Journal** — The [Northreach Journal](../Regions/Northreach/Northreach_Journal_and_Lore.md) is designed as a player-facing reference. Use it to track names, locations, and discoveries.

- **Review Your Contracts** — Each adventure is structured as a contract. Re-read the mission briefing and think about your approach.

- **Explore the Lore** — The "Wider World of Aevoria" section contains setting information about regions beyond Northreach. Your character might have come from one of these places.

## What You Need to Know

### The Campaign Style

**Northwatch Wardens** is a modular, contract-based campaign:

- **Drop-In Friendly** — Designed for 2-5 players with flexible attendance. You don't need perfect attendance to participate.
- **Order Independent** — Most adventures can be played in any order. Your DM will help determine what's available.
- **Mystery-Driven** — There's a larger story unfolding, but each adventure stands on its own.
- **Consequence-Rich** — Your choices matter. NPCs remember what you do, and settlements change based on your actions.

{{descriptive

The frontier doesn't announce itself with walls and banners—it reveals itself mile by mile. Wind combs through pine and scrub, the road narrows and widens like a breathing thing, and every settlement feels earned: a warm window in a wide, cold land.

}}

### Reading the Adventures

Each adventure follows a standard structure:

- **Contract Brief** — The mission outline and what you know going in
- **Investigation** — Gathering information and making choices
- **Encounters** — Combat, social challenges, or exploration
- **Resolution** — Multiple possible outcomes based on your decisions

There isn't always a "right" answer. The frontier is complicated, and perfect solutions are rare.

## Player Safety and Expectations

### Content and Themes

This campaign explores:
- **Frontier Survival** — Cold, isolation, and the challenges of remote living
- **Moral Ambiguity** — Not all problems have clean solutions
- **Mystery** — Strange events and ancient magic awakening
- **Community** — The importance of people looking out for each other

The tone is generally serious but not grim. There's room for levity and heroism, but the setting emphasizes realistic consequences.

{{note
##### Session Zero
Your DM should conduct a session zero to discuss boundaries, comfort levels, and any content players want to avoid. The campaign is flexible enough to accommodate different play styles and comfort zones.
}}

### Communication

Good communication makes for better games:
- **Talk to Your DM** — If something isn't working for you, speak up. The campaign is meant to be fun.
- **Work Together** — The Wardens are a team. Look for ways to help each other succeed.
- **Embrace Failure** — Not every plan works. Some of the best stories come from setbacks and complications.

## Making the Most of Your Adventure

### Engage with the World

Northreach feels alive when you interact with it:

- **Talk to NPCs** — Everyone has a story, even the bartender at the Shepherd's Crook Inn.
- **Explore Side Paths** — Not everything is on the contract. Sometimes the best discoveries happen when you follow your curiosity.
- **Ask Questions** — Your DM has thought about this world. Ask about what you see, hear, and smell.

### Build Your Story

Your character's journey is unique:

- **Make Choices That Matter to You** — Don't just follow the "optimal" path. Make choices your character would make.
- **Form Connections** — Develop relationships with NPCs and other player characters.
- **Leave Your Mark** — The frontier remembers. Your actions shape the world.

{{descriptive

When winter bites early, when rumors travel faster than wagons, and when something in the dark makes even seasoned hunters hesitate, people look for the ones who will show up anyway—boots muddy, lamp lit, and questions asked only after everyone is safe.

}}

### Keep Records

Small details become important later:

- **Names Matter** — Write down NPC names. The blacksmith you helped in session one might remember you in session five.
- **Track Locations** — Note places you've been and what happened there.
- **Record Discoveries** — Clues about the larger mystery are scattered throughout the adventures. Keep notes.

## Additional Resources

### Music and Atmosphere

The [Songs of the Northreach](../Regions/Northreach/SongsOfTheNorthreach.md) document provides curated playlists to set the mood for different situations. Consider listening during sessions or while preparing your character.

### Character Creation Guidelines

When creating a character for this campaign:

- **Low Magic Setting** — Magic exists but isn't common in daily life. Spellcasters are notable.
- **Frontier Background** — Consider why your character came to the frontier or joined the Wardens.
- **Practical Skills** — Survival, investigation, and social skills are often as useful as combat prowess.
- **Moral Flexibility** — Perfect heroes rarely last long in the grey areas of frontier justice.

## Final Thoughts

This book is a tool, not a textbook. You don't need to memorize everything or read it cover to cover. Use it as a reference when you need to understand something about the world, refresh your memory about a location, or deepen your character's connection to the setting.

The best adventures come from curiosity, courage, and characters who care about the world around them. The Northwatch Wardens need people who will show up when it matters, make hard choices when necessary, and stand by their commitments even when it's difficult.

**The frontier is vast. The mysteries are deep. The adventure awaits.**

*Welcome to the Northwatch Wardens.*
