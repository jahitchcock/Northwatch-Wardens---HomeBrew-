# Organizations of Aevoria
*A Guide to Major Factions and Groups*

In Aevoria, power is not held solely by kings and councils—it is shared among guilds, religious orders, mercenary companies, and shadowy networks. Understanding these organizations helps you navigate the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and opportunities that shape life across the realm.

This guide covers what most people know about the major factions operating in Aevoria. Your character would be aware of these organizations' public reputations, even if the details vary by region.

## The Freelance Brotherhood

**Type:** Adventuring Guild | **Headquarters:** None (Decentralized) | **Public Reputation:** Skilled, Unreliable, Competitive

The Freelance Brotherhood is less an organization and more a loose network of independent adventurers who occasionally share information, resources, and contracts. Unlike the Northwatch Wardens, the Brotherhood has no central leadership or strict code—membership is more about reputation and connections than formal registration.

### What People Know

- **No Central Authority:** The Brotherhood has no guildmaster or headquarters; members operate independently
- **Reputation-Based:** Your standing in the Brotherhood depends entirely on your accomplishments and how other members view you
- **Information Network:** Members share rumors, job opportunities, and warnings about dangerous contracts
- **Competitive:** Brotherhood members often compete for the same contracts

### How to Interact

- **Join:** Claim membership if you're an adventurer; no one will stop you, but you'll need to prove yourself
- **Network:** Visit adventurer gathering spots (certain taverns, markets) to connect with members
- **Reputation:** Completing notable jobs and honoring agreements builds trust
- **Share Information:** Trading useful information is the primary currency of the Brotherhood

### Known Leaders

None—that's the point. Some members have higher reputations than others, but no one speaks for the Brotherhood as a whole.

### Regional Presence

Wherever adventurers gather—major cities, frontier towns, and dangerous regions all have Brotherhood members passing through.

## The Unmasked Parliament (Vharoxis Authority)

**Type:** City Government / Criminal Organization | **Headquarters:** Vharoxis | **Public Reputation:** Ruthless, Innovative, Lawless

Vharoxis is ruled by those who prove themselves capable—whether through cunning, force, or both.

- **Trade:** The city's markets offer goods unavailable elsewhere (legality questionable)
- **Hire Specialists:** Need someone for a morally gray job? Vharoxis has skilled contractors
- **Never Trust Names:** People lie constantly about their identities; focus on capabilities, not claims

The Parliament's membership changes frequently and identities are often obscured. Public figures include:
- **The Architect** — Controls city development and infrastructure

- **Controlled Access:** Entry to the deep Nullwood requires permission and adherence to strict protocols

- **Learn Patience:** Decisions take time; the Court does not rush
- **Share Memory:** The Court values those who share knowledge respectfully

## Working With Multiple Organizations

### Conflicting Loyalties

Some organizations have conflicting interests:
- **Covenant of the Silent Vigil vs. Archivists of Aeor:** The Covenant views some Aeorian research as dangerous
- **Solace Trade Consortium vs. Vharoxis Markets:** Legitimate trade vs. black markets
- **Stonebound Assembly vs. Mining Companies:** Traditional dwarven methods vs. profit-focused extraction

Your character may need to navigate these tensions carefully.

### Building Reputation

Reputation with one organization may help or hinder you with others:
- **Positive:** Warden service builds trust with frontier communities and the Red Covenant
- **Neutral:** Most organizations respect professional competence regardless of affiliation
- **Negative:** Strong ties to Vharoxis makes the Covenant suspicious; Archivist obsession concerns the Silent Court
