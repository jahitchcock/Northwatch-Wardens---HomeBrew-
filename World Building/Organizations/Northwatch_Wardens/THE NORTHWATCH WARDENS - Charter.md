# The Northwatch Wardens

***Guild Charter***

{{descriptive
*Ratified in the Year of the Frostwane Moon, at the Waystone Inn, Northreach Frontier*
}}

::

## Article I — Purpose

The Northwatch Wardens exist to:

- safeguard the frontier settlements of Northreach
- investigate threats mundane and arcane
- provide aid to travelers and townsfolk
- maintain peace along the wild roads and frozen forests
- respond swiftly to emerging dangers where local forces cannot

The Wardens are not a standing army, but a fellowship of capable individuals who volunteer their blades, spells, and skills for the good of the frontier.

## Article II — Membership

Membership is open to any individual who:

- demonstrates competence in arms, magic, or wilderness craft
- swears to uphold the safety of Northreach
- agrees to abide by the Guild Code
- completes at least one sanctioned contract

Members may come and go as their lives demand. Absence does not forfeit membership, but dereliction of duty may.

## Article III — The Guild Code

{{note
##### The Six Tenets

All Wardens shall:

1. Protect the innocent
2. Honor their contracts
3. Share vital information with fellow Wardens
4. Respect the frontier's people, land, and traditions

- monster suppression

- a Lorewarden (knowledge, magic, investigations)

Decisions require at least two signatures. In emergencies, any council member may issue a provisional order.

# The Triad: Guild Leadership

The Northwatch Wardens are overseen by three leaders, each responsible for a critical aspect of operations. Together, they form the **Triad Council**—requiring at least two signatures for major decisions, but empowered to act individually in emergencies.

## Marshal Brenna Thorne

**Role:** Field Commander and Tactical Leader

**Appearance:** A weathered human woman in her early forties, with short-cropped dark hair streaked with gray. Her military bearing is unmistakable—she stands straight, moves with purpose, and her eyes constantly assess her surroundings. Scars mark her hands and forearms, evidence of years in combat. She typically wears practical leather armor reinforced with steel plates, and keeps her longsword within easy reach.

**Personality:** Fair but demanding. Marshal Thorne gives every Warden one chance to prove themselves—but only one. She values competence, honesty, and results above all else. Cross her once and you're out; prove yourself and she'll trust you with her life. She doesn't waste words, but when she speaks, people listen.

**Background:** Former military from the south—possibly imperial forces, though she never discusses it. Fifteen years ago, she founded the Northwatch Wardens after turning down what was rumored to be a command position in Solaris. Whatever drove her to the frontier, she's committed to staying.

**What People Say:**
- "She's seen things that haunt her. Makes her careful, sometimes too careful."
- "Fair but tough. She'll give you a chance, but only one. Screw up and you're out."
- "I heard she turned down a command position in Solaris to stay on the frontier. Wonder why?"

**Working With Her:** Marshal Thorne respects competence and honesty. If you take a contract, she expects you to complete it or die trying—and if you survive a failure, she expects an honest report of what went wrong. She doesn't tolerate cowardice, but she understands tactical retreat. Show her you can handle yourself in a fight, think tactically, and put the mission above personal glory, and you'll earn her respect.

## Steward Mara Fenwick

**Role:** Quartermaster and Logistics Coordinator

**Appearance:** A sturdy dwarf woman in her sixties, with steel-gray hair worn in practical braids and keen eyes that miss nothing. Her hands are calloused from years of work, and she moves with the confident efficiency of someone who knows exactly where everything should be. She dresses practically—reinforced work clothes with multiple pockets and pouches, always carrying a ledger, measuring tools, and a well-maintained shortsword.

**Personality:** Sharp, organized, and no-nonsense. Mara knows the value of everything within a copper piece, and attempting to cheat her is a waste of time. She's fair in her dealings but expects the same in return. Despite her focus on logistics, she's a surprisingly capable fighter—quartermaster doesn't mean defenseless.

**Background:** Mara has been at Waystone Inn longer than anyone else in the guild—she was running the inn's stores before Marshal Thorne arrived. Her knowledge of frontier history, trade routes, and community relationships makes her invaluable. She joined the Wardens' leadership when the guild was founded, providing the organizational backbone that keeps operations running smoothly.

**What People Say:**
- "She knows the value of everything within a copper piece. Can't cheat her."
- "Surprisingly good fighter for a quartermaster. Don't let the ledgers fool you."
- "She's been at Waystone longer than anyone. If you want to know frontier history, ask Mara."

**Working With Her:** Mara appreciates efficiency, honesty, and respect for guild resources. Return equipment in good condition, keep accurate expense records, and don't waste supplies. If you need something for a contract, make your case clearly and she'll provision you fairly. Break or lose equipment without good reason, and expect to pay for replacement. Keep your word, and she'll remember you as reliable—worth more than gold on the frontier.

## Lorewarden Elric Vael

**Role:** Scholar and Arcane Consultant

**Appearance:** A half-elf man who appears to be in his forties (likely much older), with ash-blond hair tied back loosely and thoughtful gray eyes that often seem focused on something not quite present. He's lean and slightly awkward in social situations, more comfortable with books than people. His robes are practical but well-maintained, marked with ink stains on the sleeves. He carries a weathered leather satchel filled with notebooks, reference materials, and writing supplies.

**Personality:** Bookish, curious, and genuinely passionate about understanding the world. Elric is more at home in his library than in conversation, but he's eager to discuss topics that interest him—particularly anything weird, magical, or ancient. He's patient with genuine questions but has little time for willful ignorance. Socially awkward but not unkind.

**Background:** Elric taught at a prestigious magical college in the south before coming to Northreach, though he never explains why he left. He joined the Wardens shortly after their founding, drawn by the opportunity to study frontier mysteries and ancient ruins. His expertise in arcane theory, ancient civilizations, and magical threats has proven invaluable to the guild's investigations.

**What People Say:**
- "He spends more time in his library than with people. Bit odd, but brilliant."
- "I heard he used to teach at a magical college down south before coming here. No one knows why he left."
- "If it's weird, magical, or ancient, Elric probably has a book about it. Or he'll write one."

**Working With Him:** Elric appreciates curiosity, careful observation, and respect for knowledge. Bring him interesting information—particularly about magical phenomena, ancient ruins, or unusual creatures—and he'll gladly share what he knows. Ask intelligent questions and he'll teach willingly. Protect books and records, and he'll consider you a kindred spirit. Most importantly: if you encounter something strange, document it carefully and report honestly. That information might save lives.

# Guild Operations

## The Contract System

**How It Works:**

1. **Posting:** Clients post contracts on the Waystone Board, describing the problem and offering payment
2. **Review:** Marshal Thorne reviews contracts for legitimacy and assigns difficulty ratings
3. **Acceptance:** Wardens review available contracts and accept those matching their capabilities
4. **Advance Payment:** 25% of the contract value is paid upfront for supplies and preparation
5. **Completion:** Wardens complete the contract and provide a report to the Triad
6. **Final Payment:** Remaining 75% is paid upon successful completion
7. **Guild Share:** 10% of total payment goes to guild operations (already deducted from posted price)
8. **Distribution:** Remainder is split among participating Wardens

**Contract Example: Wolves of Welton**

**Posted Contract Value:** 800 gp  
**Guild Operations Fund:** 80 gp (10% - already deducted)  
**Available to Wardens:** 720 gp  
**Advance Payment:** 180 gp (25% of 720)  
**Payment on Completion:** 540 gp (75% of 720)  

**If split 3 ways:**  
Each Warden receives 240 gp total (60 gp advance, 180 gp on completion)

**Payment Variations:**

Not all contracts pay in coin. Frontier communities often offer:
- **Trade goods:** Preserved food, furs, lumber, or crafted items
- **Services:** Lodging, meals, equipment repair, or specialized craftsmanship
- **Future favors:** Credit with community leaders or guaranteed support when needed
- **Mixed payment:** Combination of coin, goods, and services

Steward Mara evaluates non-coin payments at fair market value and helps Wardens exchange goods they don't need.

## Member Benefits

**Free Services at Waystone Inn:**
- **Lodging:** Bunk in common quarters (private rooms available for small fee)

**Equipment Requisition:**

Wardens on active contracts may requisition:

- Healing supplies (bandages, healer's kits)
- Specialized equipment for specific contracts (cold-weather gear, climbing equipment, etc.)

All requisitioned equipment must be returned or paid for if lost/damaged without good cause. Steward Mara tracks requisitions and expects detailed accounting.

## How to Join

**Requirements:**
1. Demonstrate competence (complete trial contract successfully)
2. Swear oath to uphold the guild code (Six Tenets)
3. Sign the charter
4. Receive your Warden's badge (worn or carried as proof of membership)

**Process:**

**Step 1: Initial Contact**  
Speak with Marshal Brenna Thorne at Waystone Inn. Be prepared to:
- Explain your capabilities honestly
- Describe relevant experience (combat, magic, wilderness skills, etc.)
- Answer questions about your background and motivations
- Accept that the Wardens don't require full disclosure of your past, but dishonesty discovered later means expulsion

**Step 2: Trial Contract**  
The Marshal assigns a trial contract—typically a minor but genuine threat:
- Solo or small group assignment
- Tests both competence and judgment
- Success means completing the objective; style doesn't matter
- Honest failure (with genuine effort) is acceptable; dishonesty or cowardice is not

**Step 3: Evaluation**  
The Triad reviews your performance:
- Marshal Thorne evaluates tactical competence and courage
- Steward Mara assesses professionalism and resource management
- Lorewarden Elric reviews your written report (completeness and honesty)

**Step 4: Oath Ceremony**  
If accepted, you take the oath in Waystone Inn's common room:
- Swear to uphold the Six Tenets
- Sign the charter (your name joins the roster)
- Receive your Warden's badge
- Welcome toast from assembled members

**Time Required:** The entire process typically takes 1-2 weeks, depending on trial contract availability and complexity.

## Reputation and Standing

**Building Reputation:**
- Complete contracts successfully and professionally
- Share important information with the guild
- Help fellow Wardens when possible
- Support frontier communities beyond contract requirements
- Handle difficult situations with judgment and restraint

**Losing Standing:**
- Contract failures (forgivable if honest effort was made and reported truthfully)
- Dishonesty about capabilities or contract outcomes
- Abandoning companions without overwhelming justification
- Violating the Guild Code (Six Tenets)
- Misusing guild resources or reputation for personal gain

**Consequences of Standing:**

**Good Standing:**
- Access to better contracts
- First choice of assignments
- Guild support in difficult situations
- Recommendations to other organizations
- Potential leadership roles

**Poor Standing:**
- Probation period with oversight
- Assigned only low-priority contracts
- Reduced trust from leadership and peers
- Excluded from sensitive assignments

**Code Violations:**
- Suspension (temporary removal from active roster)
- Expulsion (permanent removal; badge revoked)
- In extreme cases: active opposition from the guild

The Wardens believe in second chances for honest mistakes, but not for betrayal of trust. Marshal Thorne decides standing questions, with input from the full Triad for serious cases.
