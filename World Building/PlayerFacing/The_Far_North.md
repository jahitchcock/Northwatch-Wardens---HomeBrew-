# The Far North

*"Where the world ends, and something older begins."*

## What It Is

The Far North is a frozen wasteland beyond Palebank Village, where blizzards rage without end and the ice stretches to the horizon. It is one of the most inhospitable regions in the known world—a place where civilization ends and ancient mysteries lie buried beneath glaciers.

Few travel there by choice. Fewer return.

## Geography

### Location
- **Position:** North of Palebank Village, beyond the edge of settled lands
- **Distance:** Several days' hard travel from the frontier
- **Access:** No roads, no settlements, no safe routes

### Terrain
The Far North consists of several distinct but equally deadly regions:

**Endless Ice**  
Vast frozen plains where visibility drops to nothing during storms. The ice groans and shifts, creating treacherous conditions. Experienced guides claim the safest paths, but paths have a way of vanishing in the North.

**Shattered Glaciers**  
Massive ice formations broken by ancient forces. The fracture patterns run deep—some say all the way to bedrock. Climbers report hearing sounds from within the ice: creaking, humming, sometimes voices.

**Mountain Peaks**  
Snow-capped mountains where the wind never stops. Sound behaves strangely here—echoes arrive hours late, or words carry impossibly far.

**The Ruinfields**  
Scattered fragments of ancient structures emerge from the ice during brief thaws. Metal towers, stone facades, crystalline formations. Most are buried, but enough shows through to prove something once existed here.

## Climate

**Winter Always**  
- No true summer; temperatures rarely above freezing
- Blizzards last for days without warning
- Exposed flesh freezes in minutes
- Even the best cold-weather gear is tested

**Unpredictable Dangers**  
- Whiteout conditions with no warning
- Ice giving way to hidden crevasses
- Sudden temperature drops
- Strange lights in the sky at night

## What Lives There

### The Nomads

A handful of hardy groups survive on the edges of the Far North:

**Reindeer Herders**  
They follow migrating herds across the tundra, living in hide tents that can be moved quickly. They know safe paths and dangerous areas. They don't speak much about what they've seen in the deep north.

**Ice-Fisher Clans**  
Semi-permanent camps near unfrozen water sources. They trade preserved fish and survival knowledge. Their families have been here for generations, and they have stories going back centuries.

**Scavengers**  
The desperate or foolish who venture into the ruins looking for salvage. Metal, artifacts, anything that survived from before. Most don't come back. The ones who do are changed.

### Wildlife

Animals in the Far North are hardier than elsewhere:
- **Snow foxes** with thick white fur
- **Wolves** adapted to hunting in packs across ice
- **Mammoths** that migrate through in great herds
- **Owlbears** that den in ice caves
- **Ice elementals** that form during storms

Some travelers report stranger sightings:
- Wolves with unusual coloration
- Animals that seem more aware than they should be
- Creatures that watch from a distance but never approach
- Things moving beneath the ice

## Known Locations

### Salsvault

The most infamous location in the Far North. An ancient Aeorian ruin that rises from the ice north of Palebank. It was once a research facility and is now a frozen tomb of dangerous secrets.

*(See: Places of Northreach - Salsvault for full details)*

**What Everyone Knows:**
- Aeorian ruins from before the Calamity
- Extremely dangerous to explore
- Source of the illness called Frigid Woe
- Many explorers have died there

---

### Other Ruins

The Far North is scattered with fragments of ancient structures:
- Metal spires jutting from glaciers
- Stone walls half-buried in ice
- Crystalline formations that aren't natural
- Entrance tunnels sealed by avalanches

No comprehensive map exists. The nomads know of dozens of sites but share locations reluctantly. They consider most ruins cursed or forbidden.

## Why People Go There

Despite the danger, some venture into the Far North:

**Scholars and Researchers**  
Seeking knowledge from before the Calamity. Aeorian civilization achieved magical feats that modern mages can barely imagine. Even fragments of that knowledge are worth the risk.

**Artifact Hunters**  
Aeorian artifacts command astronomical prices. A single intact device can fund a lifetime. Most hunters die in the attempt, but the desperate and greedy keep trying.

**The Desperate**  
Those seeking cures for incurable diseases, answers to impossible questions, or power they can't find elsewhere. The Far North promises solutions—if you survive to claim them.

**Northwatch Wardens**  
Investigating the strange occurrences in Northreach. The magical disturbances, the awakened wolves, the illness in Palebank—all seem to originate from the Far North. Understanding the source might be the only way to stop the spread.

## Dangers

Multiple threats make the Far North deadly:

### Environmental
- **Cold:** Killing cold that defeats normal protective gear
- **Storms:** Blizzards that last days and eliminate visibility
- **Ice:** Crevasses hidden under snow, unstable surfaces
- **Isolation:** No rescue, no help, no way out if things go wrong

### Ruins
- **Traps:** Aeorian defensive systems still function
- **Guardians:** Ancient constructs that attack intruders
- **Unstable Magic:** Enchantments that behave unpredictably
- **Hazardous Materials:** Preserved dangers from the Age of Arcanum

### Unknown Threats
- **Strange Phenomena:** Lights, sounds, visions without clear source
- **Changed Animals:** Wildlife behaving unusually
- **The Feeling of Being Watched:** Nearly universal among travelers
- **Time Distortions:** Some report losing hours or days
