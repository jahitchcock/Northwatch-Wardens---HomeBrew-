# DM Quick Start Guide
## Running Your First Northwatch Wardens Session

**New to this campaign?** Follow these steps to run your first session tonight.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Core Concept (2 minutes)

**What is Northwatch Wardens?**
- A **drop-in guild campaign** where players are frontier mercenaries taking contracts
- Each session: Party picks a contract → completes adventure → returns to base
- **No prior story knowledge needed** — adventures work in any order
- Perfect for **2–5 players** with flexible attendance

**The Setting:**
- **Waystone Inn** = Guild headquarters (your campaign hub)
- **Northreach** = Cold frontier region with small settlements
- **The Mystery** = Ancient magic is awakening and causing problems

---

## Step 2: Read ONE Adventure (30 minutes)

**Recommended First Adventure:** [Wolves of Welton](./Season%201/Adventures/Wolves_Of_Welton/5E_Wolves_Of_Welton.md)

**Why this one?**
- Perfect for Level 1–2 characters
- Teaches players moral complexity (wolves are intelligent, not just monsters)
- Clear structure: Travel → Investigate → Choose resolution
- Reveals first clue about the campaign mystery

**Alternative Starters:**
- [Peril in Pinebrook](./Season%201/Adventures/Peril_in_Pinebrook_COMPLETE/Peril_in_Pinebrook_COMPLETE.md) — Investigation-heavy
- [The Wild Sheep Chase](./Season%201/Adventures/The_Wild_Sheep_Chase_V2/892902-The_Wild_Sheep_Chase_V2.md) — Lighthearted comedy

---

## Step 3: Meet the Key NPCs (5 minutes)

Your players will interact with these three guild leaders at Waystone Inn:

### **Marshal Brenna Thorne** — Field Commander
- Assigns contracts, handles combat situations
- Gruff but fair; ex-ranger with decades of experience
- **Roleplay Tip:** Direct, no-nonsense, focuses on mission details

### **Steward Mara Fenwick** — Quartermaster  
- Handles payments, supplies, reimbursements
- Cheerful and organized; keeps guild running smoothly
- **Roleplay Tip:** Warm and friendly, remembers everyone's names

### **Lorewarden Elric Vael** — Arcane Scholar
- Provides intelligence about magical threats
- Soft-spoken elf; researches strange phenomena
- **Roleplay Tip:** Thoughtful, asks probing questions, hints at larger mysteries

**That's it!** You don't need to memorize the full NPC roster for your first session.

---

## Step 4: Prepare Your First Session (15 minutes)

### Opening Scene: Waystone Inn (Read to Players)

> *You stand in the common room of Waystone Inn, a sturdy two-story building that serves as headquarters for the Northwatch Wardens. The smell of woodsmoke and bacon fills the air. A contract board dominates one wall, pinned with various notices.*
>
> *Marshal Brenna Thorne, a weathered human ranger with a no-nonsense demeanor, approaches your group.*
>
> **Brenna:** "Welcome to the Wardens. You've proven yourselves capable, so here's the deal: we protect the frontier. Settlements pay us to handle problems they can't solve themselves. You pick a contract, complete the job, report back. Simple."
>
> *She gestures to the board.*
>
> **Brenna:** "Right now, we've got a pressing issue. Village of Welton, two days south. Wolves attacking livestock — except these wolves are *talking*. Something's not natural about this. Contract pays 800 gold, plus guild credit. Interested?"

### If Players Accept:
1. **Give them supplies** (Mara provides rations for travel)
2. **Brief travel scene** (two days on the road, maybe one random encounter)
3. **Begin the adventure** (follow the Wolves of Welton module)

### Session Structure:
- **Hour 1:** Introduction at Waystone Inn + Travel to Welton
- **Hour 2–3:** Investigation and encounters in Welton
- **Hour 4:** Resolution (combat, negotiation, or both)
- **Ending:** Return to Waystone Inn, report to Brenna, collect payment

---

## Step 5: Understand Player Choices Matter

**Key Decision in Wolves of Welton:**
- **Kill the wolves** — Quick solution, but misses the mystery
- **Negotiate with the wolves** — Harder path, reveals they're intelligent
- **Investigate the cause** — Discover magic awakened them (campaign clue!)

**Your Role:** Present all options, let players choose, then show consequences.

**No "right" answer** — different choices lead to different outcomes.

---

## Step 6: End the Session Strong

### When Players Return to Waystone Inn:

> **Brenna:** "Good work. Payment's ready with Mara." *(800 gp distributed)*
>
> **Elric:** *(If players discovered the wolves are intelligent)* "Fascinating. Awakened intelligence where none existed before... I've been documenting similar phenomena across the frontier. Something is changing out there."
>
> *(He makes a note in his journal, looking troubled.)*

### Tease the Next Adventure:
- Point to other contracts on the board
- Mention rumors (plague in Palebank, dragon sightings near the mountains)
- Let players choose what interests them

---

## Common First-Time DM Questions

**Q: What if players refuse the contract?**  
**A:** Brenna says, "That's fine. There are other contracts." Show them 2–3 other options (point to different adventures).

**Q: What if I mess up the rules?**  
**A:** That's fine! Make a ruling, keep the game moving, look it up later. Players care more about story than perfect mechanics.

**Q: What if players kill an important NPC?**  
**A:** Let it happen. Actions have consequences. Someone else steps up, or the guild changes. The campaign is flexible.

**Q: Do I need to prep all adventures?**  
**A:** No! Only prep the one you'll run next. Adventures are modular — prep as you go.

**Q: What level should characters start?**  
**A:** Level 1 or 2 is perfect. Use pre-made characters from the [Premade PCs folder](./Premade%20PCs/) if needed.
