## Key Questions for Players

**During Character Creation:**
- "Why did your character join the Northwatch Wardens?"
  - *Suggested:* Hired for skill, seeking purpose, protecting home, fresh start

**During Ground Rules:**
- "What kind of tone do you want? Serious? Funny? Mix?"
- "How often can we play? What happens if you miss a session?"

---

## Opening Scene (Read Aloud)

> *"Dawn breaks over Northreach. You stand outside the Waystone Inn, a fortified stone roadhouse in the wilderness. Smoke rises from its chimney. Inside, the common room is warm and smells of bacon and woodsmoke.*
> 
> *Three figures wait by a long wooden table: a gruff ranger woman in worn leathers, a cheerful halfling sorting papers, and a tall elven mage with calculating eyes.*
> 
> *This is where your story begins."*

## Troubleshooting

**Players want combat now?**  
→ Save for Session 1. Tease: "The wolves are out there. You'll face them soon."

**Only 2 players?**  
→ Perfect! Campaign scales for 2–5 players.

**Player misses Session 0?**  
→ Join Session 1 as "new recruit" — hand them badge, 30-second pitch, done.

**Players don't want a guild?**  
→ Explain this is the campaign structure. Offer "probationary member" status.

## After Session 0: Next Steps

**Before Session 1:**
- Read Wolves of Welton adventure
- Prep battle maps (or theater of mind)

**Session Pattern Going Forward:**
1. Return to Waystone → report results → get paid
2. New contract offered or players choose
3. Complete adventure
4. Return and repeat
