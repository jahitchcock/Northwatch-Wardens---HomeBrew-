# Frozen Sick - DM Notes

*Quick reference and guidance for running this adventure*

\page

## Quick Reference

**Recommended Level:** 2-4 (ideal for level 2-3)  
**Session Length:** 8-12 hours (or 3-4 shorter sessions)  
**Party Size:** 3-4 players (scalable to 2-5)  
**Key NPCs:** Elro Aldataur (village leader), Tulgi Lutan (infected thief), Hulil Lutan (cultist), Ferol Sal (wight necromancer)  
**Echo Clue:** Direct evidence of Aeorian artifacts causing magical disease; major revelation about the Echo's power  
**Primary Locations:** Palebank Village, Croaker Cave, Salsvault (Aeorian ruin)

\page

## The Big Picture

### What's Really Happening

**The Truth:**
- Urgon Wenth explored Eiselcross and brought back Aeorian artifacts
- Two blue glass vials contain frigid woe—an engineered disease from Aeor
- The disease was designed to kill gods (and bypass divine healing)
- Multiple people are infected and will turn to ice statues without a cure
- The only cure is in Salsvault, an Aeorian laboratory that crashed centuries ago
- Ferol Sal, now an undead wight, continues working in the ruins

**The Conspiracy:**
- Uttolot crime family sent thieves to steal Aeorian artifacts
- Tulgi and Hulil Lutan stole items from Pelc's Curiosities
- Both thieves are now dying from frigid woe
- One vial was sold to an innocent merchant family who are now infected

\page

### Echo Connection

**What Players Learn:**
- **MAJOR REVELATION:** Direct evidence that Aeorian magic still exists and functions
- Ancient flying city of Aeor created god-killing weapons
- Magic that can't be cured by conventional healing (even divine magic fails)
- Aeorian artifacts are scattered across Eiselcross in crashed ruins
- The Echo may be reactivating or amplifying these ancient weapons
- Suggests Echo is tied to Aeor's fall and its lingering magic

**What Elric Will Want:**
- Detailed description of frigid woe symptoms and progression
- Samples of the disease if safely obtained
- Information about Salsvault's location and contents
- Any intact Aeorian artifacts recovered
- Maps or documentation from the ruin
- Theories about why Aeorian magic still functions after centuries

**Campaign Significance:**
This is the first time players encounter DIRECT evidence of the Aeorian Echo. Everything before this has been ambient effects (intelligent wolves, magical anomalies). This adventure proves:
- Aeor created weapons specifically to fight gods
- That magic still works after the Calamity
- The ruins are dangerous and full of active threats
- Someone or something may be deliberately accessing these sites

\page

## Resolution Paths

- Players feel weight of consequences
- Still get paid but hollow victory

**Potential Deaths:**

**Rewards:**

\page

### Path 3: Failed Expedition

**How:** Party dies or gives up in Salsvault

**Outcomes:**

- Players' reputation damaged

**Alternative:** Party can abandon quest and leave region

\page

### Path 4: Creative Solutions

**How:** Players think outside the box

**Examples:**
- Hire high-level cleric to try Greater Restoration (doesn't work, but creative)
- Attempt to preserve infected NPCs with ice magic (buys time)
- Send message to Uthodurn for help (takes too long but shows initiative)
- Negotiate with Tulgi/Hulil for information before going to cave

**Outcomes:**
- Reward creative thinking with advantage or clues
- Failure teaches that Aeorian magic is special
- Success can speed up timeline or reduce risk

\page

## Running the Investigation

### Palebank Village Phase

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Urgon's funeral, investigation begins
- Day 1-2: Visit crime scenes, interview NPCs

**Pacing Tips:**
- Let players drive investigation
- Multiple approaches work (stealth, combat, persuasion)
- Tulgi and Hulil can be enemies or sources of information
- Bandits can be captured and interrogated

**Information Flow:**
- Urgon's cabin → Pelc's Curiosities connection
- Tulgi → Hulil and Croaker Cave location
- Pelc's bandits → Hulil's illness and goals
- Hulil → Vial sold to Irven, disease origin
- Elro → Frigid woe information and cure location

\page

## Common Player Approaches

### "We want to rush to Eiselcross immediately"

**Consequences:** Skip Croaker Cave investigation
- Miss treasure and experience
- Don't recover first vial (still dangerous)
- Hulil might escape or cause more problems
- Lose time without gaining information

**How to Handle:**
- Elro won't fund expedition without proof disease came from Eiselcross
- Need to recover at least one vial to prove connection
- Investigation actually saves time by confirming destination

\page

### "We want to save Tulgi and Hulil"

**Perfect!** This is compassionate and interesting.

**How to Run:**
- Both are criminals but dying
- Hulil is a Tiamat cultist (evil) but desperate
- Tulgi is gruff but not irredeemable
- Saving them earns gratitude from Uttolot family (dangerous but useful)
- Father Merrikson equivalent could plead for Tulgi
- Rewards: future allies in criminal underworld, moral complexity

**Challenge:** Only 20 doses of cure, need some for Irven's family
- Forces players to prioritize
- Save criminals or innocents?
- Or find a way to save everyone?

\page

### "We want to negotiate with the bandits"

**Also valid.** Criminals can be reasoned with.

**How to Run:**
- Bandits at Pelc's are scared of Hulil
- Will betray her for immunity or gold
- Not loyal to Uttolot family, just hired help
- Can provide information without fight

**Outcomes:**
- Skip combat, gain information
- Bandits flee or help
- Still need to confront Hulil eventually
- Roleplay opportunity

\page

### "We want to destroy all the frigid woe vials"

**Dangerous but noble.**

**Consequences:**
- Makes sense from safety perspective
- But need samples for Elric to study
- Ferol has MANY more vials in storage (S4, S5)
- Can't destroy them all (too many, too dangerous)

**How to Handle:**
- Let them destroy 1-2 vials if they insist
- Point out danger of handling cracked vials
- Elric requests at least one intact sample
- Salsvault has enough that destroying a few is fine

\page

### "We want to loot Salsvault"

**Understandable but risky.**

**Challenges:**
- Constructs attack intruders
- Ferol defends his laboratory
- Many vials of deadly disease
- Flooded sections have sea creatures
- Extreme cold

**Treasures Available:**
- Aeorian artifacts (dagger, robes, equipment)
- Gold and coins (Aeorian currency)
- Spell scrolls (detect magic x2)
- Ersatz eye (in cure chest)
- Alchemist's supplies
- Historical texts and research notes

**Let them loot but enforce consequences:**
- Time spent looting extends timeline
- Greed might cost lives back in Palebank
- Some items are dangerous if misused

- Speed reduced by 5 feet
- Uncomfortable but functional

**Stage 2 (Every 10 Days):**

- Body becomes frozen monument
- Cannot be revived by normal means

\page

### Treatment

\page

### Timeline Tracking

**For DM:**
Track days since infection for each NPC and PC

| Character | Days Infected | Speed Reduction | Days Until Death |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Urgon | Dead | - | Dead at start |
| Verla | Dead | - | Dead at start |
| Tulgi | ~17 days | -5 ft | ~3 days left |
| Hulil | ~27 days | -5 ft | ~13 days left |
| Irven | 1 day | None yet | ~59 days left |
| Fenton | 1 day | None yet | ~59 days left |
| Honor | 1 day | None yet | ~59 days left |
| Magic | 1 day | None yet | ~59 days left |

**Player Characters:**
- Track individually if infected
- Roll 1d4 for incubation when infected
- Make saving throw every 10 days
- Can be cured at any stage

\page

## Complications & Twists

### If Players Get Infected

**Immediate Stakes:**
- Personal investment in finding cure
- Race against their own deaths
- Speed reduction affects combat effectiveness
- Party may split (some infected, some not)

**Handling It:**
- Don't kill PCs unfairly
- Give clear timeline and symptoms
- Allow them to feel urgency without panic
- Cure is available if they complete quest

\page

### If Irven's Family Dies

**Emotional Impact:**
- Irven and Fenton turn to ice while holding children
- Children's frozen faces show fear
- Elro pays reduced amount (100 gp)
- Village holds funeral
- Players feel weight of failure

**Alternative:**
- Some survive, some don't
- Irven dies protecting children
- Children survive but orphaned
- Players must decide what happens to them

**Future Consequences:**
- Orphans could become NPCs
- Elro requests party to care for them
- Or take them to Uthodurn
- Guilt motivation for future quests

\page

### If Players Kill Ferol Before Talking

**Consequence:**
- Miss opportunity for easy chest key
- Have to pick locks or force chests
- Lose source of information
- But still can complete quest

**Loot:**
- Ferol's keys on body
- Treasure in S10 (Ferol's chamber)
- Note revealing his tragic backstory

\page

### If Players Ally with Ferol

**Creative Approach:**
- Tell him they're helping perfect god-killer
- Convince him they share his goals
- Use to get information and keys
- Ethical complexity (lying to mad undead)

**Outcomes:**
- Ferol provides key to S18
- Explains Salsvault layout
- Warns about golem in S16
- Might even help fight constructs
- Players feel clever
- But enabled a mad necromancer's delusions

\page

### If Players Try to Purify Salsvault

**Noble but Impossible:**
- Too many undead and constructs
- Ferol will fight to death
- Clearing all rooms takes too long
- More creatures than party can handle

**Let Them Try:**
- After few rooms, exhaustion sets in
- Resources depleted
- Realize scale of task
- Must choose between crusade and cure

**Compromise:**
- Clear path to cure lab
- Seal off dangerous areas
- Report location to authorities
- Let others deal with full purge

## Echo Revelation Timing

**During Adventure:**

**Palebank Phase:**
- "These items were found in Eiselcross, in ancient ruins"
- "Urgon explored a place called Salsvault"
- "The disease can't be cured by any healing magic"

**Salsvault Phase:**
- "This is Aeorian—pre-Calamity architecture"
- "Everything still functions after centuries"
- "They created diseases to kill gods"
- "Why does their magic still work?"

**After Adventure:**

**Elric's Analysis:**
- "This is unprecedented. Aeorian magic that defeats divine intervention."
- "The Echo isn't just ambient magic. It's channeling pre-Calamity power."
- "Aeor fell but its weapons remain. Someone could weaponize this."
- "We need to find out if other ruins are active too."

**Campaign Implications:**
- First proof of Aeorian capabilities
- Shows Echo is specifically tied to Aeor
- Raises questions about who else knows
- Sets up future adventures in other ruins

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Rush the investigation phase (it builds investment)
- Kill Irven's family unfairly (give real chance to save them)
- Make disease too fast or too slow (track days carefully)
- Forget cold weather gear consequences
- Over-explain Echo connections (let players theorize)
- Pull punches on Salsvault difficulty (it should be scary)
- Let divine magic cure frigid woe (breaks the point)

**Do:**
- Emphasize horror of ice-statue deaths
- Show Aeorian tech is advanced and dangerous
- Let players feel smart during investigation
- Reward creative problem-solving
- Make NPCs memorable (especially Irven's family)
- Play up Ferol's tragic nature
- Connect back to broader Echo mystery

## Troubleshooting

### "Players want to hire high-level cleric"

**Response:** Good thinking, but frigid woe is special
- Elro tried his priests (Moradin and Corellon)
- All divine magic failed
- Designed specifically to bypass god-touched healing
- Only Aeorian cure works
- This teaches that Echo/Aeor is uniquely dangerous

### "Players taking too long in Palebank"

**Time Pressure:**
- Tulgi's condition worsens visibly
- Rumors of more infected
- Elro emphasizes urgency
- Weather window closing for sea travel

### "Party splits—some go to Eiselcross, some stay"

**Valid Choice:**
- Those who stay can protect village
- Those who go face Salsvault
- Split XP and rewards
- Or convince them unity is stronger

### "Players want to destroy Salsvault"

**Scale Problem:**
- Way too many undead and constructs
- Ferol will defend to death
- Would take weeks to clear
- Freezing environment is lethal
- Best they can do is recover cure and seal entrance

### "Everyone gets infected immediately"

**Oh no!**
- Now VERY personal stakes
- Track each PC's timeline
- Speed reductions affect combat
- Creates desperation without being unfair
- Cure still available if they push forward

## Final Thoughts

**Frozen Sick is about body horror, race against time, and major revelation.**

The adventure teaches players:
- Echo is specifically Aeorian in origin
- Pre-Calamity magic remains dangerously active
- Some threats can't be solved with strength alone
- Innocent people suffer from ancient conflicts
- Investigation and exploration matter

**Key Themes:**
- Body horror (slow transformation to ice)
- Time pressure (disease progression)
- Moral complexity (save criminals too?)
- Ancient power (Aeor's god-killing weapons)
- Sacrifice (risk infection to save others)

**This is your campaign's first true Echo revelation.** Everything before was ambient effects. This proves:
1. Aeor created world-breaking weapons
2. Those weapons still function
3. The ruins are accessible
4. Someone could weaponize this knowledge

**Trust your players. Let them feel the horror and urgency.**

The ice statues aren't just set dressing—they're warnings of what happens when Aeorian power is unleashed. The cure quest isn't just a fetch mission—it's proof that ancient evils still threaten the present.

Make it matter. Make them feel it.
