**🐺 OPENING SCENE: “Wolves at the Waystone Inn”**

**Setting:** Dusk. Snow‑flecked wind. Lanterns flickering outside the Waystone Inn.
**Goal:** Introduce the characters naturally through a shared threat.

**🎬 1. Cold Open (Read Aloud)**

Use this as your opening beat:

**The wind bites as the three of you—strangers to one another—trudge up the muddy road toward the Waystone Inn. Lantern‑light spills across the snow, promising warmth and food.**

**Then you hear it: a low, rumbling growl.**

**Two wolves slink out from behind the woodpile, ribs showing, eyes wild. Their hackles rise as they fix on you… and charge.**

This immediately:

- unites the characters
- creates urgency
- avoids awkward “you meet in a tavern” chatter

**⚔️ 2. Encounter Setup**

**Wolves (2)**

Use the stat block from your open tab (CR 1/4 wolves) — they’re perfect for a level‑1 opener.

**Terrain Features**

- Woodpile: Half-cover
- Horse trough: Difficult terrain
- Lantern post: Can be knocked over (DEX 12) to create dim light or darkness
- Inn door: Slightly ajar; NPCs may peek out but won’t intervene

**Starting Positions**

- Wolves begin 20 ft from the closest PC
- PCs are 10–15 ft apart from each other
- Wolves target the closest moving creature

This spacing forces the characters to notice each other and converge.

**🧠 3. How to Introduce the Characters Naturally**

**Round 1: Recognition**

As initiative is rolled, give each PC a 1‑sentence visual cue of the others:

- “You notice a cloaked figure to your left reaching for a weapon.”
- “A heavily armored stranger steps between you and one of the wolves.”
- “Someone behind you mutters a spell under their breath.”

This creates instant awareness without forcing dialogue.

**Round 2: Forced Cooperation**
\page


Have one wolf use **Pack Tactics** to flank a PC. This encourages another PC to intervene.

Example narration:

**“The wolf circles behind you, teeth bared. You realize the only person close enough to help is the stranger on your right.”**

This is the moment the party forms.

**🐺 4. Wolf Behavior (Simple AI)**

These wolves are:

- hungry
- desperate
- not suicidal

**Behavior Script**

- Attack the nearest target
- If reduced to 4 HP or less, the wolf attempts to flee
- If both wolves drop below half HP, they retreat together

This gives the players a sense of agency and realism.

**🎭 5. Aftermath: The First Real Interaction**

Once the wolves flee or fall, give a beat of silence:

**The wind settles. The wolves lie still in the snow.**

**For the first time, you all really look at one another.**

Then offer **three natural prompts** for the players to introduce themselves:

- The innkeeper bursts out: “By the gods! Are you all right? Come inside, quickly!” → Forces the group to enter together.
- A shared clue: One wolf has a strange frost-rimmed patch of fur — a hint toward Frozen Sick. → Gives them something to discuss.
- A practical need: Someone is injured and needs help. → Encourages cooperation.

Pick whichever fits your tone.

**Optional: Quick Hooks to Bond the Party**

Use one or more:

- Innkeeper recognizes one PC and assumes the others are their companions.
- A dropped item (a letter, a map, a charm) falls from a wolf’s mouth.
- A witness says, “You three handled yourselves well. Are you mercenaries?”
- A shared room discount if they bunk together.

All of these create cohesion without forcing roleplay.
