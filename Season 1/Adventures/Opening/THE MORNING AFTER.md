**THE MORNING AFTER: “A Warden’s First Duty”**

***A narrative tie‑in to launch Wolves of Welton as Contract #1***

**1. Morning at the Waystone Inn — Read-Aloud**

As dawn breaks over Northreach, the Waystone Inn is already alive with the smell of hearthfire and fresh bread. Snowmelt drips from the eaves. The common room is quieter than last night—more purposeful, more expectant.

Marshal Brenna Thorne stands near the long table where the guild charter has been laid out, parchment weighted by a carved stone of the Northwatch crest. She nods as each of you approaches.

“Wardens aren’t made by oaths alone,” she says. “But this is where the work begins.”

After signatures are inked and hands are shaken, Brenna gestures toward the **Waystone Contract Board**, where a single parchment has been pinned with a wolf‑tooth charm.

**2. The Contract Board Reveal**

The board is mostly empty—this is a frontier guild just getting on its feet—but one posting stands out:

**🗡️ CONTRACT: “Wolves of Welton”**

**Client:** Welton Village Council
**Reward:** 800 gp + provisions
**Urgency:** High
**Details:**

“A pack of unusually coordinated wolves has been attacking shepherds, stealing livestock, and driving families from their farms.

The council fears the wolves are acting with unnatural intelligence.

Request immediate assistance from capable Wardens.”

Brenna taps the posting with two fingers.

“Welton’s only a half‑day’s ride south. Good people. Hard winter. They wouldn’t ask for help unless they were desperate.”

**3. NPC Dialogue Hooks (Use Any That Fit Your Table)**

**Brenna Thorne (Marshal)**

“Wolves don’t normally open barn doors or outmaneuver hunting parties. Something’s wrong out there. This is exactly the kind of threat the Wardens were founded to handle.”

**Elric Vael (Lorewarden)**

“There are stories of awakened beasts in the frontier—spirits, curses, old magic. If these wolves are thinking like people… be cautious.”

**Mara Fenwick (Steward)**

“I’ve packed you travel rations and a healer’s kit. Bring back receipts for anything you need to purchase in Welton; the guild will reimburse within reason.”

**Father Merriksonn (if present from Wolves of Welton)**

He overhears the posting and stiffens.
“My brother Alexi… he vanished near Welton. If these wolves are tied to that… please, find out what happened.”

(This is a *perfect* foreshadowing seed for the awakened wolves and Alexi’s fate.)

**4. The Journey Hook — Why *Your* Party Is the One They Send**

Brenna explains:

“You handled yourselves well last night. Quick thinking, steady hands. That’s what the frontier needs.
Take this contract. Show Northreach what the Wardens can do.”

She hands them a sealed letter for the Welton Council—official recognition that the Northwatch Wardens are now operating in the region.

**5. Optional Flavor Beats to Tie Your Whole Campaign Together**

**If you want Frozen Sick to connect later:**

A trader at the inn mutters:

“Strange sickness up north in Palebank. Blue veins, slow death. Folks say it came from something dug up in the ice. Wolves acting strange in Welton… sickness in Palebank… feels like the frontier’s waking up.”

This plants the idea that **the frontier is destabilizing**, and the Wardens are stepping into a larger pattern.

**If you want Pinebrook to remain relevant:**

One of the Pinebrook premade NPCs (Flynt, Rowan, etc.) is at the inn and says:

“Welton’s shepherds trade through Pinebrook sometimes. Haven’t seen them in weeks. If the wolves are blocking the roads, it’ll hurt more than one village.”

This makes the contract feel like it matters to the whole region.

**🎯 Final Tie-In Summary**

- The players sign the charter.
- The guild immediately presents their first official contract.
- The Wolves of Welton posting is urgent, well-paid, and perfectly suited to new Wardens.
- NPCs reinforce the importance and hint at deeper mysteries.
- The party leaves with a sense of purpose and belonging.

This gives them a **clean, heroic launch** into the Wolves of Welton while grounding everything in the Northwatch Wardens’ identity.
