## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "Players don't want to join the guild"

Let them negotiate terms as mercenaries instead. The structure still works—they're contractors rather than members.

### "Players skip the charter signing"

No problem. It's flavor. Jump straight to the action.

### "Open Skirmish is too easy/hard"

**Too Easy:** Add 2-3 more wolves mid-combat ("You hear howls—more are coming!")

**Too Hard:** Brenna becomes much more active, or reinforcements arrive (Elric with spells, Gromm with axe)

### "A PC dies in Open Skirmish"

Very unlikely (balanced to be challenging but not deadly). If it happens:
- Brenna stabilizes immediately
- Mara can cast healing magic at the inn
- Treat death seriously—sets tone that Northreach is dangerous

### "Players want to investigate the wolves"

Excellent! Let them. Elric shares findings (magical traces, transmutation residue). This is better engagement—reward it.

### "Players don't want the Wolves of Welton contract"

Great—player agency! Offer alternatives:
- Peril in Pinebrook (bandits)
- Wait a few days for more contracts
- Investigate the wolf attack further
- Explore Northreach area

## DM Notes

### Pacing

**Keep momentum:**
- Don't let charter signing drag
- Keep combat moving (4-6 rounds max)
- The Morning After should feel relaxed but not stall
- Contract briefing should be quick and clear

### Tone Setting

**Establish:**
- Northreach is dangerous but not grimdark
- Guild is professional but caring
- Magic is mysterious and concerning
- Community and relationships matter

### Player Agency

**Emphasize:**
- They choose which contract to take
- They can ask questions and gather info
- They can explore Waystone Inn freely
- Their choices have consequences
