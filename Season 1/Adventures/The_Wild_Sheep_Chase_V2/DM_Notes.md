# The Wild Sheep Chase - DM Notes

*Quick reference and guidance for running this adventure*

\page

## Quick Reference

**Recommended Level:** 3-4 (ideal for level 3)  
**Session Length:** 3-4 hours (perfect one-shot)  
**Party Size:** 3-4 players (scalable to 2-5)  
**Key NPCs:** Finethir Shinebright (polymorphed wizard/sheep), Ahmed Noke (paranoid transmuter), Guz (loyal half-orc enforcer)  
**Echo Clue:** Unstable transmutation magic, overuse of powerful artifacts causing magical destabilization  
**Primary Location:** Noke's Tower (living tree compound west of Waystone Inn)

**Tone:** Comedy, lighthearted, whimsical with dark undertones

\page

## The Big Picture

### What's Really Happening

**The Truth:**
- Finethir Shinebright was a respected transmutation wizard
- He owned a Wand of True Polymorph (extremely powerful artifact)
- His apprentice, Ahmed Noke, served for decades without advancement
- Noke finally snapped and polymorphed Shinebright into a sheep
- Noke took over the tower and modified the wand (unstable now)
- Paranoia and power have driven Noke increasingly mad
- Guards polymorphed into animals serve as enforcers
- Shinebright escaped and found the party

**The Tragedy:**
- No clear villain, just broken relationship
- Shinebright treated Noke poorly for decades
- Noke's betrayal was wrong but understandable
- Both are flawed people
- Wand's overuse is destabilizing reality around tower

\page

### Echo Connection

**What Players Learn:**
- Powerful transmutation artifact (Wand of True Polymorph)
- Overuse causes magical destabilization
- Modified artifacts become unpredictable
- Transformation magic going haywire
- Suggests ambient Echo is amplifying artifact abuse

**What Elric Will Want:**
- Description of Modified Wand of True Polymorph
- Details about how modifications affected it
- Information on permanent transformations
- Understanding of transmutation instability
- Artifact itself if recovered (highly dangerous)

**Campaign Significance:**
- Shows Echo amplifies existing magic
- Demonstrates danger of artifact overuse
- Proves transformation magic is unstable in Northreach
- Connects to Wolves of Welton (intelligent animals)
- Foreshadows larger transmutation problems

\page

\page

## Running the Adventure

### Tone Management

**This is a COMEDY adventure:**
- Sheep wizard with scroll in mouth

- Talking animals
- Absurd situations
- Dark humor undertones

**But Also Tragic:**

## Common Player Approaches

### "We want to kill the sheep for being annoying"

**Uh oh!**

**How to Handle:**
- Sheep flees immediately (can outrun in town)
- Town guards intervene ("Hey! Don't hurt that sheep!")
- Scroll falls from mouth: "PLEASE HELP ME"
- If they persist, sheep escapes
- They miss entire adventure
- Later hear rumors of other adventurers helping sheep-wizard
- Feel bad about being jerks

**Better:** Let Shinebright be annoying but sympathetic
- He's desperate and scared
- Been prisoner for two years
- Just wants to be himself again
- Pays well (promises anyway)

\page

### "We want to keep the Wand of True Polymorph"

**Tempting but dangerous!**

**Consequences:**
- Shinebright FURIOUS if not restored first
- Wand is unstable (increasingly so)
- Each use increases DC
- Will eventually explode
- Powerful but deadly

**If They Keep It:**
- Track uses and DC increases
- Warn them it's getting more unstable
- Eventually malfunctions spectacularly
- Might turn PC into Gibbering Mouther
- Might explode and kill party
- Shinebright hunts them for revenge

**Elric's Warning:**
- "This artifact has been dangerously modified."

\page

### "We want to negotiate with everyone"

- Won't betray master

**Polymorphed Guards:**
- Intelligent, trapped
- Want freedom

\page

### "We want to ally with Noke against Shinebright"

- Master-apprentice relationship was abusive
- Noke deserves his tower

**Consequences:**
- Shinebright betrayed by party

- Noke grateful but unstable
- Will eventually turn on party too (paranoia)
- Wand remains dangerously unstable
- Morally gray ending

**Rewards:**
- Tower access
- Noke's gratitude (temporary)
- Same XP
- Different flavor of tragedy

\page

### "We want to destroy the wand"

**Noble but disappointing to NPCs!**

**Shinebright's Reaction:**
- "NO! That's the only way to restore me!"
- Begs and pleads
- Offers everything he has
- Ultimately accepts if convinced

**How to Destroy:**
- Magical ritual (DC 15 Arcana)
- Smash with adamantine weapon
- Disintegrate spell
- Throw into magical forge
- Let it explode naturally (wait for critical failure)

**Outcomes:**
- Shinebright stays sheep
- Noke's work destroyed

- "Please. I'm begging you."

## Echo Revelation Timing

**During Adventure:**

**When Meeting Sheep:**
- "I possess a Wand of True Polymorph."
- "It's an extremely rare artifact."
- "Noke modified it somehow."

**At Tower:**
- "All these guards were human once."
- "Noke has transformed dozens of creatures."
- "The magic here feels... unstable."

**After Wand Malfunctions:**
- "The artifact couldn't handle the stress."
- "Too much transmutation magic in one place."
- "Something about this region makes magic unpredictable."

\page

**After Adventure:**

**Elric's Analysis:**
- "Another transmutation anomaly. Like the wolves of Welton."
- "The Echo seems to amplify transformation magic specifically."
- "Overused artifacts become dangerously unstable here."
- "I'm detecting a pattern. All transmutation-related."
- "What if the Echo is somehow... encouraging this type of magic?"

**Campaign Implications:**
- Transmutation magic is specifically affected
- Artifact overuse accelerates instability
- Echo might be "teaching" magic to creatures
- Connects to Wolves of Welton mystery
- Suggests focused phenomenon, not random

**Future Hooks:**
- Are other artifacts unstable in Northreach?
- Who else has modified magical items?
- What happens if Echo continues strengthening?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Take it too seriously (embrace comedy)
- Ignore tragedy beneath humor
- Let wand be used without consequences
- Kill PCs unfairly with wand malfunction
- Force one ending (let players choose)
- Make Noke purely evil (he's sympathetic)
- Make Shinebright purely good (he's arrogant jerk)
- Rush the resolution (let it breathe)

**Do:**
- Play up absurdity (sheep with scroll!)
- Show both NPCs' perspectives
- Warn about wand danger clearly
- Let players make informed choice
- Balance comedy and pathos
- Make Bed Dragon Wyrmling memorable
- Show horror of Gibbering Mouther
- Connect to broader Echo mystery

\page

## Troubleshooting

### "Players don't care about the sheep"

**Make Shinebright Sympathetic:**
- Emphasize two years of imprisonment
- Show his desperation and fear
- Play up the horror of transformation
- Have sheep save them (warns of danger, etc.)
- Offer better rewards

### "Players want to kill Noke immediately"

**Show His Side:**
- Let Noke explain his grievances
- "Decades. I waited DECADES."
- "He treated me like furniture!"
- Players might sympathize
- Complicate moral choice

### "Combat is too easy/hard"

**Adjust on Fly:**
- Guards can flee if outmatched
- Reinforcements arrive if too easy
- Noke flees earlier if stomped
- Or fights longer if party struggling

### "Wand destroys campaign"

**If Kept:**
- It malfunctions eventually
- Explodes or creates Mouther
- Or thieves steal it
- Or Elric confiscates it
- "Too dangerous for anyone to possess"

### "Players want happy ending for everyone"

**Tough Love:**
- Can't save everyone
- Either Shinebright or Noke (or both) suffer
- Wand is inherently tragic
- Echo makes magic dangerous
- Sometimes stories are sad

\page

## Final Thoughts

**Wild Sheep Chase is about absurdity and tragedy.**

The adventure teaches players:
- Magic has costs and consequences
- Artifacts can be dangerously unstable
- Master-apprentice relationships matter
- Power corrupts even good intentions
- Sometimes there are no good answers

**Key Themes:**
- Comedy (sheep wizard, bed dragon)
- Tragedy (broken relationship, Noke's madness)
- Hubris (Shinebright's arrogance, Noke's ambition)
- Consequence (wand overuse, transformation danger)
- Choice (use wand or not?)

**This is a palate cleanser between serious adventures.**

After Frozen Sick's body horror and before Peril in Pinebrook's investigation, Wild Sheep Chase lets players laugh while still connecting to Echo mystery.

But don't forget the sadness beneath the silliness. When Noke becomes a Gibbering Mouther, when Shinebright might die trying to become himself again—those moments should hurt.

**Trust your players. Let them laugh. Let them cry. Let them choose.**

And remember: it's just a sheep. With a scroll. Trying desperately to be an elf again.

Embrace the absurdity. Feel the tragedy. Tell the story.
