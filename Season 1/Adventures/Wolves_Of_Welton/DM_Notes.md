\page

## Quick Reference

**Recommended Level:** 1-3 (ideal for level 2)  
**Session Length:** 4-6 hours (or 2 shorter sessions)

\page

## The Big Picture

### What's Really Happening

**The Truth:**
- Wolves have gained sapient intelligence due to the Aeorian Echo
- Led by an awakened wolf named "Alexi" (actually a transformed sorcerer)
- Wolves are stealing food to survive, not attacking out of malice
- They're struggling with newfound intelligence and morality
- Some wolves want peace, others want to dominate

**The Twist:**
- There's no clear "villain"
- Players must navigate a moral dilemma
- Multiple resolution paths (combat, negotiation, compromise)
- Choices have lasting consequences for Welton and the wolves

\page

### Echo Connection

**What Players Learn:**
- Wolves showing unusual intelligence and behavior
- Coordinated tactics beyond normal animal cunning
- Some can understand speech (and one can speak through magic)
- Transformation happened gradually over 3 months
- Concentrated in this region (near Salsvault, though players don't know that yet)

**What Elric Will Want:**
- Wolf samples for study
- Details about their behavior
- Any magical artifacts or anomalies found
- Information about when transformation began

\page

\page

### Path 3: Selective Elimination

\page

## Running the Investigation

### Information Sources

**Villagers (Common Knowledge):**
- Wolves unusually effective
- Started 3 months ago
- Alexi disappeared at same time
- Previous hunting party failed, one survivor (Willen)

**Village Council (Official Version):**
- Economic impact severe (can't export food, people starving)
- 100 gp reward for solving problem
- Want wolves dead or driven away
- Desperate for solution

**Willen Featherock (Traumatized Witness):**
- Attacked by wolves in forest
- Heard "voices in the night" (wolves talking)
- Saw "thunder and fire" (Alexi's spells)
- Wolves dragged him to edge of forest, didn't kill him (mercy)
- Other hunters think he's crazy

**Father Merrikson (Personal Connection):**
- Brother Alexi vanished same time attacks started
- Alexi was sorcerer (transmutation specialist)
- Merrikson suspects connection but doesn't know what
- Will plead for brother's life if Alexi revealed

\page

### Investigation Skill Checks

**Nature/Survival (DC 12):**
- Wolf tracks show unusual patterns (coordinated, planned)
- Marks on gates suggest intelligent manipulation, not animal damage

**Investigation (DC 15):**
- Timeline: Alexi disappeared exactly when attacks started
- Wolves deliberately avoid killing people
- Food stolen matches what pack would need to survive

**Arcana (DC 13):**
- Magical residue in areas of attacks (transmutation school)
- Similar to polymorph magic but permanent

**Insight (talking to Willen, DC 12):**
- He's telling the truth about voices
- He's not crazy, he's traumatized
- Wolves deliberately spared him (unusual for animals)

\page

\page

## Common Player Approaches

### "We want to talk to the wolves"

**Perfect!** This is the intended moral complexity.

**How to Run:**
- Wolves are initially suspicious/hostile
- Alexi steps forward, casts Message or Comprehend Languages
- Conversation happens (Alexi can "speak" through magic)
- Players learn truth, must decide what to do

**Let players drive negotiation. Wolves are desperate, not evil.**

\page

### "We want to kill all the wolves"

**Also valid.** This is a legitimate choice.

**How to Run:**
- Difficult combat (12-15 wolves + Alpha)
- Wolves fight desperately
- Last few wolves (including Alexi) try to negotiate or flee
- Father Merrikson devastated if Alexi dies
- Village relieved but players may feel moral weight

**Let players face consequences. This isn't "wrong" but it's complicated.**

\page

### "We want to cure the wolves"

**Creative solution!** Requires work.

**How to Run:**
- Elric needs time to research (1-2 days of downtime)
- Requires rare components (quest in itself)
- Ritual casting scene
- Choice: reverse all wolves or just Alexi?
- Feel-good ending but significant investment

**Reward creativity. This is harder but more satisfying.**

\page

### "We want to blame someone else"

**Players might suspect:**
- Father Merrikson (no, he's just worried about his brother)
- Village council (no, they're just desperate)
- Enemy nation/cult (no, this is Echo effects)
- Someone deliberately cursed the wolves (no, it's ambient magic)

**How to Handle:**
- Investigation reveals no conspiracy
- Echo is environmental, not intentional
- Sometimes there's no villain, just a situation

\page

## Roleplaying Key NPCs

\page

## Complications & Twists

### If Players Kill Alexi Before Learning Truth

- Father Merrikson identifies brother's body
- Deep regret for players (didn't know)
- Investigation reveals truth post-mortem
- Lesson about gathering information first
- Village still grateful but moment is bittersweet

\page

### If Players Reveal Truth to Father Merrikson

- He rushes to forest to see brother

- Merrikson pleads with council to spare Alexi
- Village torn: safety vs. mercy
- Players' recommendation carries weight

\page

### If Wolves Reject Negotiation

- Aggressive wolves overrule Alexi
- Combat becomes necessary (not player fault)
- Alexi might fight alongside players against own pack
- Tragic outcome: intelligence didn't make them better, just more dangerous

\page

### If Players Try to Bring Wolves Back to Waystone Inn

- Brenna skeptical but interested
- Elric fascinated, wants to study them
- Mara worried about other guests

- Potion of healing (gift from grateful priest)
- Elric's favor (research help in future)

\page

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Force a specific resolution (let players choose)
- Make wolves obviously evil (they're desperate, not malicious)
- Reveal truth too early (let investigation happen)
- Kill Alexi before reveal (rob emotional impact)
- Ignore Father Merrikson's role (he's emotionally central)

**Do:**
- Present multiple valid solutions
- Make consequences clear
- Show wolves' humanity (intelligence, morality, fear)
- Reward creative problem-solving
- Let players struggle with moral complexity

\page

## Troubleshooting

### "Players immediately want to kill wolves"

Let them try. Make combat difficult. When wolves start dying, have survivors plead for mercy. Reveal intelligence through desperation.

### "Players want to take too long investigating"

Time pressure: wolves attack another farm, villagers starving, council pressures for action.

### "Players kill Alexi before learning he's the sorcerer"

Father Merrikson identifies body. Players learn truth post-mortem. Consequences: regret, lesson learned. Still get paid.

### "Players try to bring wolves into village"

Village panics. Council forbids it. Negotiation must happen at forest border, not in town. Wolves won't enter Welton anyway (fear).

### "Players want to side with wolves against villagers"

Valid but extreme. Villages needs food. Wolves need food. Forcing village to give everything causes starvation. Negotiate balanced solution.

\page

## Final Thoughts

**Wolves of Welton is about moral complexity, not combat.**

The "best" outcome isn't predefined. Let players struggle with the choice:
- Kill intelligent beings to save village?
- Risk village to spare wolves?
- Find compromise that works for both?

**Every choice has consequences. Every consequence tells a story.**

This adventure teaches players:
- Northreach is complicated
- Not every threat is evil
- Investigation matters
- Choices have weight
- The Echo changes things in unexpected ways

**Trust your players. Let them surprise you.**
