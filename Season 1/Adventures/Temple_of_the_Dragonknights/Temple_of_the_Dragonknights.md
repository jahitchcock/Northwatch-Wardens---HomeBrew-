**Temple of the Dragonknights**

## Northwatch Wardens Integration (DM)

**Campaign Connection:** This adventure shows **factions exploiting** the awakening magic. Venomfang and the cult are drawn to and empowered by the Aeorian Echo, using it to fuel dark rituals that wouldn't otherwise be possible.

**DM Secret Resources:** For the truth behind this adventure, see:
- **[World Building/DMEyesOnly/Places_Secrets.md](../../../World%20Building/DMEyesOnly/Places_Secrets.md)** - "Temple of the Dragonknights: Heroic Tomb" section
- **[World Building/DMEyesOnly/Northreach.md](../../../World%20Building/DMEyesOnly/Northreach.md)** - Adventure integration details
- **[World Building/DMEyesOnly/The_Aeorian_Echo.md](../../../World%20Building/DMEyesOnly/The_Aeorian_Echo.md)** - Campaign arc context

**Key Secrets:**
- The temple was built over a sealed **Aeorian facility focused on draconic weapons research**
- The "Dragonknights" actually fought post-Calamity Aeorian threats
- Each tomb is a **ward anchor**; desecration weakens the seals
- The Aeorian facility below is responding to the Echo and attempting to break free
- The cult's rituals are only possible because magic is destabilizing
- The facility contains **dragon-killing bioweapons** that threaten all dragons if reactivated

**Player Discovery:** Characters should sense that the cult is more powerful than expected and that the temple has deeper significance. The connection to ancient Aeorian magic can be hinted at through symbols, architecture, or magical effects.

# DM Notes: Temple of the Dragonknights

## Adventure Overview

**Theme:** Ambition, corruption, and the exploitation of rising magic — a young dragon and cult seek power from magical disturbances

**Core Tension:** Venomfang (young green dragon) and her kobold cult are drawn to the Temple ruins by the Aeorian Echo. Are they a genuine threat or opportunistic scavengers?

**Level Range:** 3-5 (campaign climax adventure)

**Expected Duration:** 4-6 hours (single or two-session adventure)

**Key NPCs/Enemies:**
- **Venomfang** — Young green dragon (clever, ambitious, not mindlessly evil)
- **Kobold Cult** — Dragon-worshipping minions (organized, fanatical)
- **Joel Andersmith** — Farmer, initial quest giver (injured by kobolds)
- **Northcrest Locals** — Guards, blacksmith, innkeepers (provide support)

## Central Mystery (Aeorian Echo Connection)

**This is the CONVERGENCE adventure** — Other factions are responding to the Aeorian Echo.

**The Setup:**
- Venomfang sensed magical power radiating from the Temple of the Dragonknights
- The temple itself is a *confluence point* — ancient ley lines intersect here, amplified by Salsvault's reactivation
- Kobolds worship Venomfang and seek to establish a power base
- The cult is *exploiting* the Aeorian Echo, not causing it
- If Venomfang succeeds, she becomes a regional power; if she's stopped, the Echo continues elsewhere

**What Players Should Learn:**
1. The Aeorian Echo is attracting predators and opportunists (dragons, cults, intelligent creatures)
2. Salsvault's activation created "ripples" of magical energy across Northreach
3. The temple is a *symptom* of the Echo, not its source (that's Salsvault)
4. More factions will mobilize if the Echo isn't contained

**What Remains Hidden (for future campaigns):**
- How to actually *stop* the Aeorian Echo (requires returning to Salsvault or finding other solutions)
- Whether Venomfang is working alone or has allies
- Other creatures drawn to magical convergence points

## Common DM Pitfalls

### 1. Venomfang as a Pure Villain
**Problem:** If Venomfang is played as a mindless monster, players miss the moral complexity.

**Solution:** Venomfang is *ambitious*, not evil. She wants:
- Power and territory (reasonable dragon goal)
- To avoid direct conflict with strong opponents (pragmatic)
- To use kobolds as expendable minions (ruthless but logical)

**If confronted, she can negotiate:**
- "Why die for peasants who mean nothing to you? I offer gold, magic, *alliance*."
- "Kill my kobolds if you must. I'll find more. But attack *me*, and you'll regret it."

**She's a **Level 3-5 boss** — deadly in direct combat. Negotiation or clever tactics (poison gas, collapsing temple) are valid strategies.**

### 2. Kobolds as Cannon Fodder
**Problem:** Kobolds feel like XP pinatas with no personality.

**Solution:**
- Kobolds are *fanatical* worshippers — they believe Venomfang will ascend to godhood
- They use traps and Pack Tactics (advantage via flanking)
- If half the kobolds die, the rest surrender OR flee to warn Venomfang
- Captured kobolds reveal temple layout, Venomfang's lair location, and cult goals

### 3. Temple Feels Like a Linear Dungeon Crawl
**Problem:** "Clear room, fight enemies, repeat" becomes monotonous.

**Solution:**
- **Environmental hazards:** Crumbling ruins, trapped corridors, flooded chambers
- **Multiple entry points:** Kobolds guard the front, but ruins have a back entrance (Stealth check)
- **Roleplay opportunities:** Captured kobolds, dragon negotiations, ancient lore inscriptions
- **Time pressure:** Kobolds are preparing a ritual to "awaken" the temple's ley line energy

### 4. Venomfang Fight Is Too Easy or Too Hard
**Problem:** Young green dragon (CR 8) can TPK a Level 3-4 party, or die in 2 rounds if ambushed.

**Solution:**
- **She's smart:** Uses Poison Breath, then flies away to recover
- **She has escape plans:** If reduced to 50% HP, she offers terms OR flees
- **Environment matters:** Temple has collapsed pillars (cover), acid pools (hazards), high ceilings (she can fly out of melee reach)
- **Adjust on the fly:** If party is struggling, Venomfang toys with them. If party is dominating, kobold reinforcements arrive.

**Alternative Victory Conditions:**
- Drive Venomfang away (she flees when bloodied)
- Collapse the temple (bury her lair, force relocation)
- Negotiate a truce (she leaves Northreach in exchange for treasure/safety)

## Resolution Outcomes

### Path A: Kill Venomfang and Destroy Cult
**Result:**
- Northcrest is saved; kobolds scatter
- Party earns dragon hoard (1,500 gp + magic items)
- **Aeorian Echo outcome:** Temple remains a convergence point; another creature may claim it later
- **Reputation:** Heroes of Northreach; Lorewarden Elric requests debrief

### Path B: Drive Venomfang Away (Non-Lethal Victory)
**Result:**
- Venomfang retreats, wounded and humiliated
- Kobolds abandon temple without their dragon leader
- Treasure partially looted (dragon takes most of hoard)
- **Aeorian Echo outcome:** Same as Path A (temple still radiates magic)
- **Future hook:** Venomfang may return in later campaigns

### Path C: Negotiate with Venomfang
**Result:**
- Dragon agrees to leave Northreach in exchange for tribute (500 gp + magic item)
- OR dragon agrees to non-aggression pact (won't raid settlements, party won't hunt her)
- Kobolds follow Venomfang elsewhere
- **Aeorian Echo outcome:** Temple remains unclaimed but monitored
- **Reputation:** Controversial — some see party as pragmatic, others as cowards
- **Future hook:** Venomfang may become an ally (or betray party later)

### Path D: Destroy or Seal the Temple
**Result:**
- Collapse temple to deny access to magical convergence point
- Venomfang escapes but loses her power base
- **Aeorian Echo outcome:** Magical energy disperses (reduces regional instability)
- **Lorewarden Elric's reaction:** Impressed ("You addressed the root problem, not just the symptom")

## Tactical Notes

### Combat Encounter Scaling

**Part I: Kobolds vs. Guards (Northcrest)**
- **2-3 players:** 4 kobolds
- **4-5 players:** 6 kobolds
- **Scaling:** Guards help players; if guards die, kobolds flee

**Part II: Andersmith Farm Investigation**
- **Exploration-focused** — no combat unless players trigger kobold scouts
- **If combat:** 2-3 kobolds (scouts)

**Part III: Temple Approach**
- **Outer Ruins:** 6-8 kobolds (guards)
- **Trapped Corridor:** Spiked pit traps (DC 13 Perception to detect, DC 12 Dex save to avoid, 2d6 piercing damage)

**Part IV: Temple Interior**
- **Main Chamber:** 8-10 kobolds + 1 kobold inventor (CR 1/4, uses improvised explosives)
- **Venomfang's Lair:** Venomfang (Young Green Dragon, CR 8) + 2-4 kobold guards

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Poison Gas Pools:** 10 ft radius, DC 12 Con save or poisoned for 1 minute
- **Crumbling Pillars:** Can be knocked over (Athletics check) to create cover or crush enemies
- **Flooded Chambers:** Difficult terrain, Venomfang can swim freely

### Venomfang's Combat Tactics

1. **Round 1:** Poison Breath (recharge 5-6), then fly to high perch
2. **Round 2-3:** Fly-by attacks (Bite and claw), stay out of melee reach
3. **Round 4+:** Use lair actions (if applicable) — rockfall, poison cloud
4. **If bloodied (50% HP):** Attempt to flee OR offer negotiation
5. **If cornered:** Fight to the death (Frightful Presence to scatter weak PCs)

**Lair Actions (Optional):**
- **Rockfall:** DC 13 Dex save or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage
- **Poison Fog:** 20 ft radius cloud, DC 12 Con save or poisoned

### Non-Combat Challenges

**Investigation (Andersmith Farm):**
- DC 10 Survival: Track kobolds back to temple ruins (northwest mountains)
- DC 12 Investigation: Find cult symbols (dragon claw marks, stolen supplies)
- DC 10 Medicine: Stabilize Joel Andersmith (he provides clues)

**Stealth (Temple Approach):**
- DC 13 Stealth: Avoid kobold sentries (bypass outer guards)
- DC 15 Stealth: Infiltrate temple via collapsed back entrance

**Negotiation (Venomfang):**
- DC 15 Persuasion: Convince her to leave peacefully
- DC 13 Intimidation: Threaten her with superior force (must demonstrate combat prowess first)
- DC 12 Deception: Trick her into believing party has dragon-slaying weapons

## Improvisation Toolkit

### If Players Get Stuck (Investigation Phase)

1. **Joel Andersmith provides clear directions:** "The kobolds came from the northwest mountains. There's an old temple up there — ruins from before the Calamity."
2. **Northcrest guards offer to scout:** "We'll mark the trail for you. Just deal with whatever's up there."
3. **Venomfang sends a kobold emissary:** "Our great master wishes to speak with you. Come to the temple. She promises safe passage." (This is a lie — ambush.)

### If Players Avoid the Temple

- Kobold raids escalate (attack Northcrest directly)
- Venomfang personally attacks the town (forces confrontation)
- Lorewarden Elric sends urgent message: "The temple is a magical convergence point. You must investigate."

### If Players Attack Venomfang Immediately

- She's surprised but uses Poison Breath immediately
- Kobolds swarm party (reinforcements arrive)
- If party is winning, she flees
- If party is losing, she offers terms: "Enough. You fight well. Leave now, and I'll let you live."

### If Players Are Dying

- Kobolds focus on capture, not killing (want to sacrifice prisoners)
- Northcrest guards arrive as reinforcements (late but helpful)
- Venomfang decides party isn't worth the effort and flies away (insult: "Not even worth eating")

## Rewards & Aftermath

### Standard Rewards
- **Northcrest Gratitude:** 500 gp + free supplies
- **Venomfang's Hoard (if killed):** 1,500 gp, 2d4 gems (100 gp each), 1d4 magic items

- Defeating/driving away Venomfang: Party reaches **Level 5**

### Reputation Changes
- **Northcrest:** Heroes (permanent discount at shops)
- **Northreach Wardens:** Elite status (Brenna promotes party to senior Wardens)
- **Lorewarden Elric:** Fascinated by temple's ley line convergence (requests report)

## Aeorian Echo Foreshadowing

**Revelations to drop during the adventure:**

1. **Temple's Magical Resonance:**
   > "The temple radiates magical energy — not from the ruins themselves, but from *beneath* them. Ley lines converge here, amplified by something far away."

2. **Venomfang's Motivation (if negotiated):**
   > "I sensed power here. Power that called to me. Something is waking the old magic, and I intend to claim it before others do. Why should gods and wizards hoard such strength?"

3. **Kobold Cult Beliefs:**
   > "The Great Venomfang will ascend! The old magic rises, and she will become a GOD! We are her chosen!"

4. **Temple Inscriptions (if investigated):**
   > "The Dragonknights swore an oath: 'We guard the sleeping things, that they may never wake.' Beneath the temple are carved warnings in Draconic: 'Sealed by divine will. Do not disturb.'"

5. **Lorewarden Elric's Debrief (when party returns to Waystone Inn):**
   > "A dragon drawn to a ley line convergence? Troubling. The Aeorian Echo isn't just reactivating ruins — it's creating *beacons* across Northreach. Every creature with magical sensitivity can feel it. Venomfang was just the first. We need to find a way to stop this before worse things arrive."

### Venomfang's Opening Dialogue (if party enters lair)

> *A sleek green dragon lies coiled atop a pile of gold and bones. Her eyes gleam with intelligence as she regards you.*
>
> "Adventurers. How... expected. You've slaughtered my servants, disturbed my lair, and now you stand before me. Brave? Or foolish? Perhaps both. What do you want here?"

### Venomfang's Negotiation Offer (if party is strong)

> "You fight well. Better than the so-called 'Dragonknights' who built this tomb. I have a proposition: I will leave this region. In exchange, you will give me one magic item from your possession, and you will not pursue me. Refuse, and I will kill you where you stand. Choose quickly."

### Venomfang's Threat (if party refuses negotiation)

> *The dragon rises, wings unfurling.*
>
> "So be it. I will feast on your corpses and add your treasures to my hoard. Know this: I am Venomfang, and I will be remembered as the dragon who **broke** the heroes of Northreach!"

### Venomfang's Retreat (if bloodied)

> *The dragon snarls, blood dripping from her wounds.*
>
> "This isn't over. I will remember your faces. One day, you will regret sparing me — or not killing me fast enough."

*She flies away through a collapsed section of ceiling, escaping into the mountains.*

### Lorewarden Elric's Debrief (when party returns to Waystone Inn)

> *Elric listens intently to your report, his face grave.*
>
> "A young dragon drawn to the temple. Kobolds worshipping her as a god. And beneath it all, ley lines converging, amplified by... Salsvault, I presume. The Aeorian Echo is creating magical beacons. Venomfang was opportunistic, but she won't be the last. We need to find a way to stop the Echo at its source. But first, rest. You've earned it."

## Post-Session Tasks

- [ ] Update Campaign Tracker: Temple of Dragonknights completed
- [ ] Note if Venomfang was killed, driven away, or negotiated with
- [ ] Record party's reputation in Northcrest (Heroes status)
- [ ] Track magic items acquired from Venomfang's hoard
- [ ] Award XP or milestone level-up (Party → Level 4 or 5)
- [ ] Note party's reaction to Aeorian Echo revelations
- [ ] Prepare Elric's follow-up hooks (investigate other convergence points? Return to Salsvault?)
- [ ] If Venomfang escaped, note potential future encounter

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Venomfang killed our entire party in one round!"
→ If TPK occurs, have Venomfang decide party is "worth more alive" — capture them for ransom to Northcrest. Players escape (skill challenge) and get second chance.

### "We want to negotiate before even entering the temple!"
→ Allow it. Venomfang sends a kobold emissary. Negotiate terms: tribute, territory concessions, non-aggression pact. This is a valid (and clever) resolution.

### "We want to collapse the entire temple to kill Venomfang!"
→ Excellent creative solution. Require Engineering checks (DC 15) to rig collapse safely. Venomfang escapes (flying) but loses her hoard and power base.

### "The kobolds are too weak; they die in one hit!"
→ Kobolds should use Pack Tactics (advantage via flanking) and traps. If party steamrolls them, add reinforcements or have them flee to warn Venomfang.

### "We refuse to fight a CR 8 dragon; we're only Level 3!"
→ Validate their concern. Emphasize negotiation, environmental tactics (collapse temple, poison gas, etc.), or fleeing as viable options. Venomfang doesn't fight to the death if she can avoid it.

## Next Session Hook

After defeating/driving away Venomfang and debriefing with Elric:

> "The Aeorian Echo is attracting predators. Venomfang was clever and ambitious, but others may be less... negotiable. We need to understand the Echo's full extent. I've marked three potential convergence points on my map. Which will you investigate next?"

This sets up potential future adventures or allows party to pursue other goals in Northreach.

**Introduction**: Venomfang, a young green dragon, has recently perched herself in the burial ground of an ancient group of dragon slayers

known as “The Dragonknights.” As she hunts in the nearby forest, her kobold minions gather to raid the nearby town of Fallcrest to bring

riches to themselves and their master, but it seems Venomfang and her minions may have a darker, more sinister purpose…

The town of Northcrest contains multiple key locations such as The Flowing Mug Inn, a blacksmith, and a market square.

### The Flowing Mug Inn

The adventurers begin in The Flowing Mug. How they got there and how they met is up to the players and the DM. The Flowing Mug is your typical tavern as well as Inn. It is known by the local townsfolk as a trustworthy, “stand-up” Inn.

## B. Kobolds vs. Guards

After hearing noises from outside The Flowing Mug Inn, the adventurers investigate outside to find 4 guards rushing to action against 6 invading kobolds, who appear to have green skin. Resolving this encounter yields 100 XP divided amongst the party.

### Saving Joel Andersmith

Joel Andersmith, a farmer from North of town, will be found lying against the wall of The Flowing Mug after the fight. If asked, he will provide the following information

#### Additional Information

- The kobolds have raided his farm and murdered his family.
- He believes that the kobolds may be more kobolds in the forest to the North

After this information is given, Joel will burst into tears over the loss of his family. The town guards will escort him to the Inn and pay for his stay as long as he needs. The guards will also insist that they must stay in town to protect it from potentially worse threats.

### Capturing a Kobold

\page


If the players manage to capture and interrogate a Kobold, a DC 15 Persuasion or DC 12 Intimidation check will conclude with the captured enemy revealing information.

#### Additional Information

- The location of Poisontip Cavern: North past the farmstead and through the brush.
- The location of Fallcrest’s missing supplies: Poisontip

Cavern

- The fate of Joel’s family: His wife and son are dead, but they needed his daughter.
- Information regarding Venomfang and her intentions will not be revealed.

## C. Andersmith Farm

About a mile North of town, bordering the forest, lies what’s left of Andersmith Farm. Smoke rises all along the crops and slaughtered animals lie scattered across the ground. A house overlooks the farmland on a small hill to the East, and a barn lies in semi-ruin to the North, bordering the forest.

### The Barn

Upon closer inspection of the barn, the entire Eastern half is caved in, with piles of broken wood lying scattered across the ground. Blood tracks lead outside the barn but eventually fade. A DC 7 Survival check will reveal the tracks’ destination; the brush behind the barn. There are also the remnants of ransacked barrels and supplies.

### The Farmhouse

Walking in the front door of the farmhouse (which hangs off of one of its hinges) reveals the interior; a main room previously used as a living room & dining room, and two hallways that branch to the left and right.

#### The Left Hall

Down the left hall there is a bedroom on each side. The bedroom on the left is Joel’s son’s room. He lies on the ground with his gut split open, and a simple shortsword at his side.

Across the hall is Joel’s daughter’s room, which is empty save for the ruined furniture and a bloodstained teddy bear lying in the bed.

#### The Right Hall

Down the right hall there is a washroom to the left and another bedroom. In the bedroom, a middleaged woman lies leaning against a large bed with a slit throat.

A DC 10 Survival check will reveal tracks that lead to the back side of the barn,

## D. The Trail

The players will eventually follow tracks that reveal an unnatural looking thicket. This can be cut through or, with a DC 11 Investigation check, a vine connecting to a mechanism can be found that pulls the brush up. The following trail is 5 ft. wide and must be traveled single-file.

A passive perception of 12 will find a small lock of hair along the trail. An intelligence check DC 15 will discern that it’s human.

### The Creek

Following the trail through the woods for a mile leads to an opening to a small creek. Small, slippery stones create a path across the creek. Crossing safely takes a successful DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics check. A failure results in falling into the creek, where two quippers sense fresh meat. Crossing the creek awards 20 XP to each character. After crossing the creek spears topped with human skulls begin to dot the trail.

### Cave Entrance

After a curve in the trail, a DC 12 Passive perception check will signify movement around the corner. Turning the corner reveals two kobolds currently roasting a pig on a spit. They are currently eating so any attempt at stealth is successful. This encounter yields 50 XP divided amongst the party.


# Part II: Poisontip Cavern

*In this part of the adventure, the players will eXPlore and fight their way through Poisontip Cavern. The cavern is extremely dark and those who don’t have darkvision will be completely blind. The 2nd floor is 15 ft. above the 1st…*

## Area 1

This section of the cavern is relatively straightforward. The players will immediately be attacked by a single winged kobold upon entering. This encounter yields 50 XP divided amongst the party.

After this encounter, the players may notice the cliff drop below them, into a small underground lake. Depending on their ability to see, they may stumble into it. See AREA 3 for details. A small passage on the right of the lake requires a DC 8 Acrobatics check to cross.

## Area 2

After finding the passage way and taking the stairs up to area 2, The players encounter 3 kobolds sleeping in corresponding tents (unless the winged encounter was very very loud). This encounter yields 75 XP. The following items are found in tents.

| **Additional Information**   * In the Northernmost tent is 25 gp and a piece of parchment that appears to be torn out of a book. See PUZZLE CLUE * In the tent to the Southeast there are two Potions of Healing. * The secret door on the Eastern wall takes a DC 10   Perception check to notice, and a DC 14 Athletics check to budge open.   * Inside the secret door are all the town’s missing supplies, which the players may inform the townspeople of, or return them themselves (100 gp & 20 XP each if they do it themselves). |

The skill used to cross safely is Acrobatics. The base DC is 0 for 80 lbs or lower at one time. The DC increases the more weight there is.

If any player falls in, roll a percentage. If the percentage is under 15% the player takes 1d6 piercing damage from a stalagmite, otherwise they take no damage. There are 4 hungry quippers waiting in the water below the bridge. Crossing the bridge yields 75 XP divided amongst the party.

### Triggering the Trap

Following the bridge, immediately after is a pressure triggered trap that is triggered by anyone over 120 lbs. If triggered, anyone in that 5x5 ft. square is pelted with rocks, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Disarming the trap yields 10 XP to the one who disarmed it.

### The Ritual

Venomfang’s goal with this ritual is up to the DM. In my game Venomfang wants to revive a Dracolich, so her goal here was to create one of the gemstones required to store the Dracoliches soul, but again, this ritual’s purpose is up to the DM.

## Area 5

Nothing terribly significant here. Two sleeping chambers for previous members of the Dragonknights now being occupied by the cultists. A DC 10 Investigation check will reveal a Potion of Healing in a nightstand in the Northernmost room.

## Area 6

# Part IV: Loose Ends

*The party has saved Joel’s daughter, faught a dragon and her minions, and potentially saved the town of Fallcrest. What’s next?*

## A. Returning Home

On the opposite side of the entrance, is an exit with a path down the mountain. To any party members who were paying attention, it shouldn’t be hard for them to find their way back. The exit is on the Southern side of the mountain near the entrance to Poisontip Cavern.

## B. Hope Restored

Joel can be found upstairs in The Flowing Mug Inn, reading a book in his room. Returning Clementine to him lights a fire in his heart that can only be described as renewed hope for his life.

## C. Supplies Returned

Returning the supplies to the market garners some benefits (100 gp & 20 XP each and the townsfolks approval.)

## D. Venomfang

Venomfang returns to her lair to find it in ruin, and one of her children is missing. This allows for the DM to do whatever he/she wants with this villain, who certainly wants revenge.

## E. Sera and the Temple

Sera returns to her home city of Waterdeep to report to Archmage Vysellon on the strange goings-on in the Dragonknight Temple.
