The adventure teaches players:
- Not all authority is trustworthy
- Investigation reveals truth

- Protect the innocent and vulnerable
- Ancient magic has modern consequences

**Key Themes:**
- Corruption (sheriff's betrayal)
- Innocence (baby dragon)
- Justice (exposing truth)
- Motherhood (Rorn's devotion)
- Discovery (Aeorian sites)

**This is a bridge adventure:**

- Expands Aeorian network
- Introduces dragons as allies

**Balance the cute with the dark:**
- Baby dragon is adorable

- Echo mystery deepens

**Trust your players. Let them investigate. Let them befriend dragons. Let them be heroes.**

Pinebrook needs them. The dragon wyrmlings need them. And the Echo mystery needs them to keep digging.
