# DM Quick Start Guide

*Read this first if you're new to running Northwatch Wardens*

## Welcome, Dungeon Master!

You're about to run **Northwatch Wardens: Season One**, a frontier guild campaign set in the wild lands of Northreach. This guide gets you up and running fast so you can start gaming without spending days reading.

### What Makes This Campaign Special?

**Modular Adventures:** Players can tackle contracts in any order. Miss a session? No problem—someone else takes that contract.

**Guild Framework:** The Northwatch Wardens provides structure and motivation. Players always have a home base (Waystone Inn) and a reason to adventure (guild contracts).

**Central Mystery:** All adventures connect to the Aeorian Echo—ancient magic resurfacing in Northreach. Players discover clues gradually, in any order.

**Variable Attendance:** Designed for 2-5 players per session with drop-in/drop-out friendly structure.

**Moral Complexity:** Few clear-cut "good vs evil" scenarios. Players make meaningful choices with lasting consequences.

## First-Time DM Tips

### Don't Worry About...

**Voices:** You don't need different voices for every NPC. Vary your body language, speech patterns, and attitudes instead.

**Rules Mastery:** Look up rules as needed. If it slows the game, make a ruling and check later.

**Perfect Prep:** You can't predict everything. Focus on knowing the next scene and improvising the rest.

**Beautiful Maps:** Theater of the mind works great. Simple grids work too.

### Do Focus On...

**Player Agency:** Let players try creative solutions. Say "yes, and..." when possible.

**NPC Motivations:** Know what NPCs want. It makes them feel real even without deep backstories.

**Consequences:** Player choices should matter. Success and failure both create interesting stories.

**Pacing:** Keep things moving. Skip travel, summarize shopping, fast-forward boring parts.

**Fun:** If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right. Everything else is secondary.

## The Northreach Frontier

### Quick Geography

## The Aeorian Echo (Spoiler-Free)

### What You Need to Know

Ancient magical energy is spreading through Northreach. Each adventure provides clues about its source and nature. Players piece together the mystery over multiple sessions.

**Key Points:**
- Magic is destabilizing (creatures awakening, artifacts activating)
- Source is Salsvault, buried Aeorian ruins far north
- Various factions are noticing and reacting
- Players discover this gradually—don't info-dump

**Your Role:**
- Plant clues in adventures (they're already written in)
- Let players speculate and theorize
- Reveal information when earned through investigation
- Build tension and mystery

**See:** Mystery Revelation Guide for detailed guidance

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

### "Players ignore the contract"

Absolutely fine! Let them explore Northreach. Use random encounters, introduce rumors, or have consequences develop without them (village attacked, innocent people die).

### "Players split the party"

Manageable in this campaign since adventures are discrete. One group can take a contract while others handle a different one. Resolve one, then the other.

### "Someone wants to kill an important NPC"

Let them try. NPCs have consequences for being killed. The guild might expel them, or create a new problem to solve. Don't protect NPCs with plot armor—embrace the chaos.

### "Players are stuck"

Introduce a helpful NPC (Elric can provide research, Brenna can suggest tactics, Mara knows local gossip). Or let them fail forward—missed clues lead to complications, not dead ends.

**See:** Troubleshooting Guide for comprehensive solutions
