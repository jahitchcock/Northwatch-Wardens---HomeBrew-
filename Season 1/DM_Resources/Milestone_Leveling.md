# Milestone Leveling Guide

*When and how to level up your party in Northwatch Wardens*

\page

## Milestone Philosophy

**Northwatch Wardens uses milestone leveling, not XP.**

Why:
- Simplifies bookkeeping
- Allows variable attendance (players level together)
- DM controls pacing
- Rewards story progression, not grinding

\page

## Standard Progression (6 Adventures)

### Level 1 → 2
**When:** After Open Skirmish  
**Why:** First combat, joined guild, survived first fight  
**Duration:** 1 session

### Level 2 → 3
**When:** After completing 1-2 full adventures  
**Why:** Proven competence, understand world  
**Duration:** 2-4 sessions

**Adventures typically completed:**
- Wolves of Welton
- Peril in Pinebrook
- Wild Sheep Chase

\page

### Level 3 → 4
**When:** After completing 2-3 more adventures  
**Why:** Experienced wardens, major threats overcome  
**Duration:** 4-6 sessions

**Adventures typically completed:**
- Frozen Sick (major milestone)
- Any remaining early adventures

### Level 4 → 5
**When:** Just before Temple of the Dragonknights  
**Why:** Need power for finale  
**Duration:** 1-2 sessions before capstone

**Award this when:**
- All other adventures completed
- Players ready for final challenge
- Echo fully understood

\page

## Flexible Milestones

### Adventure-Based

**Award level after:**
- Completing full adventure (start to finish)
- Returning to Waystone Inn
- Debriefing with guild leadership

**Don't award mid-adventure** (breaks pacing)

\page

### Session-Based

**Alternative:** Level every 2-3 sessions regardless of content

**Benefits:**
- Predictable progression
- Easier for drop-in/drop-out
- Players feel consistent growth

**Drawbacks:**
- Less narratively satisfying
- Might level mid-adventure

**Use if:** Variable attendance or casual campaign

\page

### Story-Based

**Award level after significant story beats:**
- Discovering major Echo clue
- Saving important NPC
- Defeating major villain
- Major moral decision

**Benefits:**
- Feels earned
- Tied to narrative
- Memorable moments

**Drawbacks:**
- Subjective
- Might feel arbitrary

**Use if:** Story-focused players

\page

## Fast Progression (Short Campaign)

**Goal:** Levels 1-5 in 8-10 sessions

### Accelerated Milestones

**Level 1 → 2:** After Open Skirmish (session 1)  
**Level 2 → 3:** After first adventure (sessions 2-3)  
**Level 3 → 4:** After second adventure (sessions 4-6)  
**Level 4 → 5:** After third adventure (sessions 7-9)  
**Temple:** Final sessions (10-12)

**When to Use:**
- Limited time
- Players want power fantasy
- Focus on higher-level play

\page

## Slow Progression (Long Campaign)

**Goal:** Levels 1-5 in 20+ sessions

### Delayed Milestones

**Level 1 → 2:** After Open Skirmish (session 1)  
**Level 2 → 3:** After 2-3 adventures (sessions 5-8)  
**Level 3 → 4:** After 3-4 more adventures (sessions 12-16)  
**Level 4 → 5:** After final pre-Temple content (sessions 18-20)  
**Temple:** Sessions 21-24

**When to Use:**
- Extensive side content
- Players enjoy current level
- More time at each tier

\page

## Variable Attendance Adjustments

### Present Players Level, Absent Don't

**Problem:** Player misses multiple sessions, falls behind

**Solution:**
- Award catch-up level when they return
- "The guild sent you on a training mission while we were away"
- Keep party at same level

\page

### Everyone Levels Together

**Recommended Approach:**
- Award milestones to whole party
- Absent players level when they return
- Prevents power imbalance

\page

## Adventure-Specific Guidance

### After Open Skirmish
**Always:** Level 1 → 2  
**No exceptions:** This is foundation

### After Wolves of Welton
**Typical:** Level 2 → 3  
**Unless:** Players ran multiple adventures first

### After Frozen Sick
**Typical:** Level 3 → 4  
**Why:** Major, long adventure

### Before Temple
**Always:** Level to 4 or 5  
**Why:** Temple requires this power level

\page

## Signs You Should Level Players

### Level Too Slowly

**Signs:**
- Encounters feel overwhelming
- Players discouraged
- Same tactics for 5+ sessions
- Asking "when do we level?"

**Solution:** Award milestone sooner

\page

### Level Too Quickly

**Signs:**
- Encounters too easy
- Players steamrolling content
- Running out of appropriate adventures

**Solution:**
- Delay next milestone
- Increase encounter difficulty
- Add stronger enemies

\page

### Just Right

**Signs:**
- Challenging but winnable encounters
- Players excited about new abilities
- Natural story progression
- Asking "are we leveling soon?" (but not complaining)

**Don't change anything**

\page

## Multi-Party Campaigns

### Different Groups, Same Campaign

**Challenge:** Group A is level 3, Group B is level 2

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Separate Progressions**
- Each group levels independently
- Scale adventures to each group
- Different timeline

**Option 2: Unified Progression**
- Both groups level when either hits milestone
- Shared world state
- Requires coordination

**Option 3: Level Bands**
- Allow 1-level difference
- Group A: levels 3-4
- Group B: levels 2-3
- Converge for finale

\page

## Between-Session Leveling

### When to Level

**End of Session (Recommended):**
- Players leave excited
- Time to review new abilities
- Start next session ready

**Start of Session:**
- Brief level-up
- Jump into action quickly
- Less time to plan

**Between Sessions:**
- Players level at home
- Ready for next session
- No table time used

\page

## Special Circumstances

### Mid-Adventure Level Up

**Generally avoid, but if necessary:**
- Long rest mid-adventure
- Significant story beat
- Players really need power boost

**How:**
- Narrative explanation ("You feel power awakening")
- Represents training/growth during adventure
- Only do once per campaign

\page

### Delaying Level for Story

**Scenario:** Players meet milestone but story works better if they level later

**Options:**

**Option 1: Award Immediately**
- Always reward accomplishment
- Don't punish success

**Option 2: Delay with Reason**
- "Guild wants to debrief before promoting you"
- "Elric needs to evaluate your magical growth"
- Award within 1 session

**Recommended:** Always award immediately. Don't delay rewards.

\page

## Leveling Ceremony (Optional)

### Make It Special

**Guild Recognition:**
- Brenna promotes them to higher rank
- Mara throws celebration
- Elric provides arcane training

**Benefits:**
- Feels earned
- Memorable moment
- RP opportunity

**Keep it Brief:** 5-10 minutes, not whole session

## Troubleshooting

### "Players complaining they haven't leveled"
**Response:** Acknowledge, explain pacing, award milestone if appropriate

### "One player missed multiple sessions and is behind"
**Solution:** Level them when they return, explain as training

### "Players leveling too fast for remaining content"
**Solution:** Introduce Season 2 content early, scale up difficulties

### "Players want to stay at current level"
**Rare but valid:** Let them, award milestone later when ready

\page

## Final Guidance

**Milestone leveling is flexible. Use it as a tool to:**
- Reward accomplishment
- Control pacing
- Keep party balanced
- Maintain engagement

**Don't:**
- Withhold milestones as punishment
- Level randomly without reason
- Create power imbalances
- Over-think it

**Trust your instincts. Level players when it feels right.**
