## "Yes, And..." Technique

When players try something unexpected:

1. **Say "Yes"** (or "Yes, but...")
2. **Add complication** ("...and that attracts attention")
3. **Let them try** (set DC, roll)
4. **Narrate outcome** (success or failure forward)

## Handling Unexpected Choices

### Players Go Off-Script

**Don't panic. Ask:**
1. "What's your goal?"
2. "How do you want to achieve it?"
3. "What resources are you using?"

**Then:**
- Set DC or opposition
- Let dice determine outcome
- Improvise consequences

## Random Tables

**See:** Random Tables (DM Reference chapter) for:
- NPC names
- Weather
- Random encounters
- Treasure
- Quest hooks

## Key Principle

**Improvisation is about:**
- Listening to players
- Building on their ideas
- Saying "yes, and..."
- Making failure interesting
- Keeping momentum

**You don't need to know everything. You need to react well to anything.**
