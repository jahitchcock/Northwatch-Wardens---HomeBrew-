# First Session Guide

*Step-by-step walkthrough for running Session 0 and Session 1*

\page

## Overview

Your first session actually consists of **two parts:**

1. **Session 0** (Character Creation & Guild Introduction) — 1-1.5 hours
2. **Session 1** (Open Skirmish & First Contract) — 2-3 hours

You can run both in one long session (3-4 hours) or split them across two shorter sessions. Most groups do them together.

\page

## Session 0: Characters & Charter

**Goal:** Create characters and establish guild membership  
**Duration:** 1-1.5 hours

### Part 1: Welcome & Expectations (15 minutes)

**What to cover:**

1. **Campaign Pitch:**
   > "You're members of the Northwatch Wardens, a frontier protection guild in the wild lands of Northreach. Each session, you'll take contracts to help settlements, investigate threats, and uncover mysteries. The campaign is modular—miss a session and someone else can take that contract. You'll make meaningful choices that affect the region."

2. **Safety Tools:**
   - Discuss lines and veils (content to avoid)
   - Explain X-card or other safety mechanics
   - Ask about any hard boundaries (horror, body horror, violence, etc.)

3. **Table Expectations:**
   - Session length and frequency
   - Attendance expectations (drop-in friendly but communicate)
   - Rules disputes (DM makes ruling, discuss after)
   - Spotlight sharing (everyone gets their moment)

\page

### Part 2: Character Creation (30-45 minutes)

**Option A: Build From Scratch**

1. Choose race and class
2. Roll or assign ability scores (your preference)
3. Select background
4. Pick equipment
5. Write personality, bonds, flaws
6. Name and appearance

**Guidance:**
- Any PHB race/class works
- Backgrounds should tie to frontier life
- Encourage variety in party composition
- All start at level 1

\page

**Option B: Use Premades**

1. Players browse premade PCs (in "Premade PCs" folder)
2. Each selects one they like
3. Customize name, appearance, personality
4. Read over abilities and equipment
5. Ready to play

**Premades Available:**
- Human Fighter (tank)
- Dwarf Cleric (healer/support)
- Elf Ranger (scout/archer)
- Halfling Rogue (skills/stealth)
- Half-Elf Bard (face/support)
- Human Wizard (damage/utility)

**Recommendation:** Premades get you playing faster. Offer them for first-timers.

\page

### Part 3: Guild Introduction (5 minutes)

**Read Aloud:**

> The Northwatch Wardens were founded three years ago to bring order to the lawless frontier of Northreach. Based at Waystone Inn, the guild accepts contracts from local settlements—everything from wolf hunts to missing persons to strange magical occurrences.
>
> The guild is led by three individuals known as the Triad:
> - **Marshal Brenna Thorne** commands field operations
> - **Steward Mara Fenwick** manages logistics and supplies
> - **Lorewarden Elric Vael** researches threats and provides intelligence
>
> You've all recently arrived at Waystone Inn, drawn by rumors of steady work, adventure, and a chance to make a difference on the frontier.

\page

### Part 4: Charter Signing Ceremony (15 minutes)

**Read Aloud:**

> Marshal Brenna Thorne stands before the common room hearth, her scarred hands resting on a worn wooden table. On it lies a single document—the Guild Charter.
>
> "Before you take your first contract," she says, her voice firm but not unkind, "you need to understand what you're signing up for. The Northwatch Wardens aren't heroes from the songs. We're people doing hard, often thankless work to keep these frontier communities safe. Read the charter. If you agree to its terms, sign it. If not, there's the door."

**Player Action:** Each player can read the charter (provide printed copies or read key sections aloud)

\page

**The Guild Charter (Key Points):**

*Full text in Campaign Assets; summarize these points:*

1. **Mission:** Protect Northreach's people and investigate threats
2. **Authority:** Wardens operate with limited legal authority; settlements can accept or refuse help
3. **Compensation:** Fair payment for completed contracts
4. **Code of Conduct:** No murder, no theft from innocents, no abuse of authority
5. **Risk:** Dangerous work; guild isn't responsible for injuries or death
6. **Expulsion:** Serious violations result in expulsion and revocation of guild privileges

**DM Note:** Don't read the entire charter—it's long. Hit these highlights and let players skim the document.

\page

**Signing Scene:**

Go around the table. Each player describes:
1. **Their character's approach** (confident? nervous? suspicious?)
2. **Their character's signing** (flourish? simple mark? hesitation?)
3. **A one-sentence introduction** (name, what they're good at, why they joined)

**Example:**
> *Grimm, a grizzled dwarf fighter, approaches the table with a steady gait. He reads through the charter carefully, nods once, and signs with a firm hand.*
>
> "Grimm Ironforge. Been fighting for coin long enough. Figured it's time I fought for something that matters. I'm your shield."

**Outcome:** All players are now official members of the Northwatch Wardens.

\page

**Brenna's Response:**

> Marshal Brenna nods as the last signature dries. "Good. You're Wardens now. That means something out here."
>
> She looks each of you in the eye. "Tomorrow morning, we run a training exercise. You'll work together, follow orders, and show me you can handle yourselves in a fight. Dismissed."
>
> As you head to your rooms, Steward Mara calls out cheerfully, "Breakfast at dawn, dears! You'll want to eat well—Brenna's training exercises are... intense."

**End Session 0 Here (If Splitting Into Two Sessions)**

If running both Session 0 and 1 together, take a 10-minute break before continuing.

\page

## Session 1: First Blood

**Goal:** Run opening combat and introduce adventure structure  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

### Part 1: Morning of the Exercise (5 minutes)

**Setting:** Early morning, just after dawn. Cold spring air, mist rising from the forest. Players have eaten breakfast and been given practice weapons.

**Read Aloud:**

> Mist clings to the forest floor as Marshal Brenna leads your group north of Waystone Inn. She's wearing her usual practical armor, greatsword strapped across her back. 
>
> "This is a simple exercise," she explains. "There's a clearing ahead. I've set up targets—straw dummies representing bandits. Your job is to neutralize the threat. Work together. Watch each other's backs. Show me you're ready for real contracts."
>
> She pauses at the forest edge. "Remember—communication is key. Call out threats. Support your teammates. Don't be a hero."
>
> The clearing lies ahead, maybe thirty yards through the trees. You can see the straw dummies standing in a rough semicircle.

**Player Interaction:** Let players ask questions, discuss tactics, prepare spells.

\page

### Part 2: The Ambush (Open Skirmish Combat)

**Combat Setup:**

As players approach the clearing, real wolves attack. This isn't a training exercise—it's a genuine threat.

**Read Aloud:**

> As you step into the clearing, something feels wrong. The straw dummies are torn apart, scattered across the bloodied ground. 
>
> Then you hear it: a low growl from the tree line.
>
> Six pairs of glowing eyes emerge from the shadows. Wolves. Large ones. And they're moving toward you with predatory intent.
>
> Behind you, Brenna curses. "Defensive positions! These aren't part of the exercise!"

**Initiative:** Roll initiative. Include Brenna as an NPC ally.

\page

**Combat Details:**

**Enemies:** 
- 6 wolves (split across CR levels based on party size)
- See Open Skirmish for exact stats and scaling

**Terrain:**
- 30x30 foot clearing
- Light forest cover on edges (half cover)
- Scattered straw dummy debris (difficult terrain)

**Brenna's Role:**
- Fights alongside the party
- Calls out tactical advice
- Won't steal spotlight—focuses on defense
- Takes down 1-2 wolves herself
- Can save a downed PC if needed

**Pacing:**
- Should last 4-6 rounds
- Keep it dynamic—wolves try to flank and attack vulnerable targets
- Not meant to be deadly, but should feel dangerous

\page

**Tactical Notes:**

**Wolf Tactics:**
- Focus on lightly-armored targets
- Use Pack Tactics for advantage
- Try to drag downed prey away from the group
- Flee when reduced to half strength

**Adjusting Difficulty:**
- **Too easy:** Add 1-2 more wolves mid-combat ("more emerge from the trees")
- **Too hard:** Have Brenna take down wolves faster or reinforcements arrive (Elric with magic)
- **Deadly:** Have Brenna intercept a killing blow or stabilize downed PCs

**DM Goals:**
- Players learn combat mechanics
- Players experience teamwork importance
- Set tone: Northreach is dangerous
- Establish Brenna as competent and protective

\page

### Part 3: After the Battle (5-10 minutes)

**Read Aloud:**

> The last wolf falls. Silence returns to the clearing, broken only by heavy breathing and the rustle of wind through trees.
>
> Marshal Brenna wipes blood from her blade, her expression grim. "Well. That wasn't supposed to happen." She surveys the carnage—torn straw dummies, dead wolves, and your battered group.
>
> "You held your own. That's good." She sheaths her greatsword. "But wolves don't attack in numbers like this. Something's wrong. These aren't normal animal behaviors."
>
> She begins examining the wolf bodies, frowning. "We need to report this to Elric. He'll want to examine them. Come on—back to Waystone Inn."

**Observation Check (DC 12 Nature or Investigation):**
- Wolves show signs of unusual intelligence (coordinated tactics)
- Eyes have faint magical gleam (not natural)
- Some wear crude collars or markers (possibly tracked)

**Player Reward:**
- Each player gains 50 XP
- Level up to 2 immediately (or after returning to inn)

**Travel back to Waystone Inn (summarize quickly)**

\page

### Part 4: The Morning After (Roleplay Scene)

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Goal:** Meet the Triad, roleplay, establish guild atmosphere

**Setting:** Waystone Inn common room, mid-morning. Warm fire, smell of stew. Other guild members present (background NPCs).

**Read Aloud:**

> Back at Waystone Inn, the common room feels warm and safe after the morning's chaos. Steward Mara Fenwick immediately fusses over your injuries, bringing bandages and hot stew. "Eat, eat! You're too thin!"
>
> Marshal Brenna speaks with Lorewarden Elric Vael by the fire. The half-elf scholar is examining a wolf pelt, his fingers stained with ink and blood, muttering about "unusual arcane traces."
>
> The three leaders turn to face you as you settle in.

\page

**NPC Interactions:**

Let players initiate conversation. NPCs respond based on personality:

**Marshal Brenna Thorne:**
- Direct: "You handled yourselves well. Better than some veterans."
- Concerned: "But those wolves... that's not normal behavior."
- Practical: "Rest up. I'll have a real contract for you tomorrow."

**Steward Mara Fenwick:**
- Motherly: "You poor dears! Your first day and you nearly get eaten!"
- Gossip: "Wolves that aggressive? Haven't seen that in twenty years."
- Cheerful: "But you're safe now. More stew?"

**Lorewarden Elric Vael:**
- Curious: "Fascinating. Traces of transmutation magic in their tissues."
- Eccentric: "Did you notice their eyes? The luminescence? I'll need to run tests."
- Distracted: "What? Oh, yes, well done. Very brave. Now where did I put my spectacles?"

\page

**Information Available:**

If players ask questions:

**"What caused the wolf attack?"**
- Brenna: "Unknown. Wolves usually avoid large groups."
- Elric: "I'm detecting magical anomalies. Needs further study."

**"Is this related to other threats?"**
- Brenna: "Possibly. We've had reports of strange occurrences across Northreach."
- Elric: "There's a pattern. I'm researching historical precedents."

**"What happens now?"**
- Brenna: "You rest. Tomorrow, we have a real contract if you're interested."
- Mara: "A village called Welton is having trouble with wolves. Seems timely, doesn't it?"

**"Can we explore Waystone Inn?"**
- Absolutely! Let them meet other residents (see NPC Roster)
- Thom Greyoak (innkeeper), Sera Windwhisper (bard), Gromm Ironhide (blacksmith)
- Mara can show them the contract board, armory, library

**Let players drive this scene.** Answer questions, roleplay NPCs, establish atmosphere.

\page

### Part 5: First Contract Briefing (10-15 minutes)

**When players express interest in a contract:**

**Read Aloud:**

> Marshal Brenna retrieves a folded document from the contract board. She spreads it on a table before you.
>
> "This came in three days ago from Welton, a farming village two days southwest. They're losing livestock to wolf attacks. Normally we'd send someone to handle it quickly, but after this morning..." She taps the document. "I want to know if it's connected."
>
> Lorewarden Elric leans over. "If these wolves show the same magical traces, it could indicate a broader phenomenon. Very concerning."
>
> Steward Mara adds, "The village council is offering 100 gold pieces, plus room and board. Not a bad contract for your first official mission."

**Show players the contract document** (in Opening/Wolves - Contract.md)

\page

**Contract Details (Wolves of Welton):**

- **Employer:** Welton Village Council
- **Threat:** Wolves attacking livestock
- **Payment:** 100 gp (split among party)
- **Location:** Welton, 2 days southwest
- **Urgency:** Medium (attacks increasing in frequency)
- **Additional Notes:** Village elder Mathilde is point of contact

**Players Can:**
- Accept immediately
- Ask more questions
- Request different contract
- Request supplies or information

\page

**Information Available:**

**"Tell us about Welton."**
- Brenna: "Small farming community. Maybe 200 people. Hardworking folks."
- Mara: "They're famous for their wool. Shepherds, mostly. This is their livelihood."

**"What equipment do we get?"**
- Mara: "Basic supplies—rations, rope, torches. Anything special, you'll need to buy."
- See Reward Guidelines for starting equipment budget

**"How dangerous is this?"**
- Brenna: "Normal wolves? Not very. But after this morning, I don't know what 'normal' means anymore."

**"Can we get help from other wardens?"**
- Brenna: "Most are on contracts already. You'll be on your own."
- If party is only 2 players, Brenna might assign an NPC ally

**"What if we want a different contract?"**
- Brenna: "There's one other available—Pinebrook is having trouble with bandits. Or you can wait a few days for more contracts to come in."
- Most groups choose Wolves of Welton (it's designed as the first adventure)

\page

### Part 6: Preparation & Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

**If Players Accept the Contract:**

> Marshal Brenna nods approvingly. "Good. You leave tomorrow at dawn. Steward Mara will provide rations and supplies."
>
> She rolls up the contract. "Remember—you're representing the guild. Be professional. Help these people. And report back anything unusual."
>
> Lorewarden Elric calls after you. "If you find any unusual animal remains, please bring samples! For science!"

**Players Can:**
- Buy equipment (Waystone Inn has basic gear)
- Talk to NPCs for information
- Plan their approach
- Rest for the journey

**End Session Here**

Players should be:
- Level 2
- Equipped for travel
- Ready to depart for Welton next session

\page

## Session Wrap-Up Checklist

**After the session:**

- [ ] Award XP/level (players should be level 2)
- [ ] Update Campaign Tracker with session notes
- [ ] Ask for player feedback (what they enjoyed, concerns)
- [ ] Note any NPC interactions or player choices
- [ ] Prepare Wolves of Welton adventure for next session

**Between Sessions:**

- [ ] Read Wolves of Welton thoroughly
- [ ] Review Encounter Scaling if needed
- [ ] Prepare any maps or handouts
- [ ] Consider player character hooks (integrate backgrounds into adventure)

\page

## Troubleshooting

### "Players don't want to join the guild"

Ask why. If they want to be independent adventurers, that's fine—the guild can hire them as mercenaries. Adjust the charter signing to a contract negotiation. The structure still works.

### "Players skip the charter ceremony"

No problem. It's flavor, not essential. Jump straight to the training exercise.

### "Open Skirmish is too easy/hard"

**Too Easy:** Add more wolves mid-combat. "You hear howls in the distance—more are coming."

**Too Hard:** Brenna becomes more active. "The Marshal charges forward, intercepting two wolves." Or reinforcements arrive (Elric with spells, Gromm with axe).

### "A PC dies in the first combat"

Unlikely (it's balanced to be challenging but not deadly), but if it happens:
- Brenna stabilizes them immediately
- Have clerics at the inn (Mara can cast healing magic if needed)
- Treat it seriously—Northreach is dangerous

### "Players want to investigate the wolves instead of taking the contract"

Great! Let them. Elric can share his findings (magical traces, transmutation residue). This is actually better engagement—they're following the mystery.

### "Players want a different first contract"

Let them choose! Peril in Pinebrook also works as a first adventure. Just make sure you've read it.

### "Players split up"

Unlikely in the first session, but if it happens, handle scenes sequentially. Most of the content keeps the party together (combat, briefing).

\page

## What Players Should Know After Session 1

By the end, players should understand:

**The Guild:**
- They're members of the Northwatch Wardens
- Based at Waystone Inn
- Take contracts to help settlements
- Led by the Triad (Brenna, Mara, Elric)

**The World:**
- Northreach is a dangerous frontier
- Strange magical events are happening
- Communities rely on the guild for protection

**The Mystery:**
- Wolves are behaving strangely
- Magical traces detected
- Something larger might be going on

**The Structure:**
- They choose which contracts to take
- Adventures are modular (can be tackled in any order)
- Their choices matter and have consequences

**Next Steps:**
- They have a contract (Wolves of Welton)
- They'll travel to Welton next session
- They can prepare and ask questions

\page

## DM Notes

### Pacing

First sessions often run long due to:
- Character creation takes longer than expected
- Players ask lots of questions
- Combat is slow as everyone learns

**Adjust by:**
- Using premade characters
- Summarizing charter instead of reading it all
- Using average damage for enemies to speed combat
- Time-boxing roleplay scenes ("We have 10 minutes before we need to move to the next scene")

### Player Engagement

**Encourage:**
- Questions about the world
- Interaction with NPCs
- Discussion of tactics and plans
- Character personality moments

**Discourage:**
- Rules lawyering in first session (make rulings, discuss later)
- Excessive planning (action is better than perfect plans)
- PvP or character conflict (establish cooperative tone early)

\page

### Setting Expectations

**Be Clear About:**
- **Tone:** Grounded, frontier survival, investigation-focused
- **Structure:** Modular, player choice-driven
- **Death:** Possible but not the goal; play smart
- **Attendance:** Drop-in friendly; communicate absences
- **Session Length:** Set and respect time limits

**Ask Players:**
- What they want from the campaign
- What type of content they enjoy (combat, roleplay, exploration)
- Any concerns or boundaries

\page

## Quick Reference: Open Skirmish Combat

**Initiative Order:**
1. Roll for all players
2. Roll for wolves (group initiative)
3. Brenna acts on player initiative +2

**Wolf Tactics:**
- Target lowest AC/HP
- Use Pack Tactics (advantage when ally is adjacent)
- Attempt to drag downed prey
- Flee at half HP remaining

**Brenna's Actions:**
- Action: Attack (greatsword, +5 to hit, 2d6+3 damage)
- Bonus Action: Command ally ("Focus fire on that one!")
- Reaction: Intercept attack targeting vulnerable ally

**Adjust for Party Size:**
- **2 players:** 4 wolves, Brenna very active
- **3 players:** 5 wolves, Brenna moderately active
- **4 players:** 6 wolves, Brenna less active
- **5 players:** 7-8 wolves, Brenna only supports

\page

## After Session 1: Next Steps

**You've successfully run your first session!**

### Before Next Session:

1. **Read Wolves of Welton** (full adventure)
2. **Review Adventure Sequencing** (if players chose a different contract)
3. **Check Encounter Scaling Guide** (adjust for your party size)
4. **Review Session Opening Templates** (how to start future sessions)

### Long-Term Prep:

1. **Read Campaign Arc** (understand the big picture)
2. **Read Mystery Revelation Guide** (pace the Echo mystery)
3. **Review Milestone Leveling** (when to level players up)
4. **Skim other adventures** (prepare for player choice)

### Campaign Tracking:

- Update **Campaign Tracker** with session notes
- Record player choices and NPC reactions
- Track which clues players discovered
- Note any improvised NPCs or story elements

\page

## Final Encouragement

Your first session sets the tone for the entire campaign. Focus on:

- **Fun over perfection** — Mistakes happen; laugh them off
- **Player agency** — Let them make choices and shape the story
- **NPCs as people** — Bring the Triad to life
- **Mystery over exposition** — Tease the Echo; don't explain it yet
- **Consequences** — Their actions matter

You've got this. The adventure begins now.

**Welcome to the Northwatch Wardens.**
