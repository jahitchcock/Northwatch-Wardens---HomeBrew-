# Adventure Sequencing Guide

*Recommendations for adventure order and connections*

\page

## Core Principle

**All adventures work in any order.** This guide provides recommendations, not requirements.

Players choose contracts. Your job is to make their choice work, not force a specific sequence.

\page

## For New DMs: Recommended Sequence

If you're running this campaign for the first time, this sequence provides good pacing and mystery revelation:

### 1. Open Skirmish → The Morning After → First Contract
**Levels:** 1-2  
**Duration:** 1 session

**Why First:**
- Mandatory introduction
- Establishes guild structure
- First Echo clue (wolf aggression)
- Sets tone

**Next Options:** Wolves of Welton or Peril in Pinebrook

\page

### 2. Wolves of Welton
**Levels:** 2-3  
**Duration:** 2 sessions

**Why Second:**
- Clear Echo connection (awakened intelligence)
- Moral complexity introduction
- Investigation-focused (teaches skills)
- Referenced in opening ("wolves in Welton")

**Next Options:** Any adventure; Wild Sheep Chase for palette cleanser

\page

### 3. The Wild Sheep Chase
**Levels:** 3  
**Duration:** 1 session

**Why Third:**
- Palette cleanser after moral weight of Wolves
- Comedy tone provides variety
- Short (good between longer adventures)
- Shows Echo affects powerful magic users

**Next Options:** Peril in Pinebrook or Frozen Sick

\page

### 4. Peril in Pinebrook
**Levels:** 2-3  
**Duration:** 2 sessions

**Why Fourth:**
- Social investigation (different challenge type)
- Introduces artifact angle
- Shows factions exploiting Echo
- Builds mystery without being too dark

**Next Options:** Frozen Sick (major revelation)

\page

### 5. Frozen Sick
**Levels:** 3-4  
**Duration:** 3 sessions

**Why Fifth:**
- Major Echo revelation (Salsvault, Aeorian ruins)
- Darker tone (body horror, stakes increase)
- Direct evidence of Echo's source
- Changes campaign from mystery to known threat

**Next Options:** Temple of the Dragonknights (finale)

\page

### 6. Temple of the Dragonknights
**Levels:** 4-5  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions

**Why Last:**
- Season 1 finale
- Faction exploitation of Echo (consequence)
- Combat-heavy capstone
- Sets up Season 2
- Requires Echo knowledge to fully appreciate

**Next:** Season 2 or other campaigns

\page

## Alternative Sequences

### Mystery-Focused Progression

**For players who love investigation:**

1. Open Skirmish (introduction)
2. Wolves of Welton (first clue)
3. Peril in Pinebrook (artifacts discovered)
4. Frozen Sick (major revelation)
5. The Wild Sheep Chase (breather before finale)
6. Temple of the Dragonknights (finale)

**Why:** Frontloads investigation, builds tension steadily, comic relief before finale

\page

### Combat-Focused Progression

**For players who prefer action:**

1. Open Skirmish (introduction)
2. Peril in Pinebrook (shorter investigation, bandit combat)
3. The Wild Sheep Chase (fast-paced, multiple encounters)
4. Wolves of Welton (can be combat-heavy if they choose)
5. Frozen Sick (survival horror, tough encounters)
6. Temple of the Dragonknights (epic finale)

**Why:** Emphasizes combat, investigation still happens but less focus

\page

### Varied Tone Progression

**For balanced experience:**

1. Open Skirmish (introduction)
2. The Wild Sheep Chase (lighthearted start)
3. Peril in Pinebrook (social intrigue)
4. Wolves of Welton (moral complexity)
5. Frozen Sick (body horror, dark)
6. Temple of the Dragonknights (epic finale)

**Why:** Alternates tones, prevents fatigue, maintains interest

\page

### Rapid Mystery Revelation

**For impatient players or short campaigns:**

1. Open Skirmish (introduction)
2. Frozen Sick (major revelation immediately)
3. Wolves of Welton (shows Echo variety)
4. Peril in Pinebrook (faction exploitation)
5. Temple of the Dragonknights (finale)
6. (Skip Wild Sheep Chase or run as side quest)

**Why:** Gets to the point fast, short campaign, Echo revealed early

\page

## Player-Driven Sequencing

### Let Players Choose

**How it Works:**
- Present 2-3 contract options each session
- Players pick based on interests
- Adjust pacing based on choices

**Contract Board Options:**

**After Open Skirmish:**
- Wolves of Welton (animal attacks)
- Peril in Pinebrook (disappearances, corrupt official)

**After First Adventure:**
- Wild Sheep Chase (wizard emergency, comedic)
- One of the above (if not chosen)
- Frozen Sick (disease outbreak)

**Mid-Campaign:**
- Any remaining adventures
- Temple of the Dragonknights (when level 4-5)

\page

### Guiding Player Choice

**Without Railroading:**

**Use Urgency:**
- "Frozen Sick spreading fast—time-sensitive"
- "Wolves attacks increasing—village desperate"
- "Sheriff in Pinebrook just sent urgent request"

**Use NPC Recommendations:**
- Brenna: "Wolves of Welton is a good first contract—straightforward."
- Elric: "Frozen Sick sounds fascinating—I'd love samples!"
- Mara: "Pinebrook pays well and it's not too dangerous."

**Use Player Interest:**
- Combat-focused: suggest Temple or Frozen Sick
- Roleplay-focused: suggest Wolves or Pinebrook
- Comedy-loving: suggest Wild Sheep Chase

\page

## Leveling and Sequencing

### Milestone Progression

**Level 1-2:** Open Skirmish (1 milestone)

**Level 2-3:** First 1-2 adventures
- Wolves of Welton
- Peril in Pinebrook
- Wild Sheep Chase

**Level 3-4:** Next 2-3 adventures
- Frozen Sick (longer, worth more XP)
- Any remaining lower-level adventures

**Level 4-5:** Before Temple
- Level up just before Temple
- Or complete remaining adventures first

\page

### If Players Level Too Slowly

**Problem:** They're level 2-3 but haven't leveled in 3+ sessions

**Solutions:**
1. Award milestone between adventures
2. Run multiple adventures before leveling
3. Add bonus encounters (random, side quests)
4. Speed up leveling pace (session-based)

\page

### If Players Level Too Quickly

**Problem:** They're level 4 after only 2 adventures

**Solutions:**
1. Slow milestone pacing (3-4 adventures per level)
2. Up-scale remaining adventures (increase difficulty)
3. Run Temple early (they're ready)
4. Introduce Session 2 content early

\page

## Connecting Adventures

### Thematic Connections

**Wolves of Welton + Frozen Sick:**
- Both show Echo's transmutation effects

- Magic reshaping life

**Peril in Pinebrook + Temple:**
- Both show factions exploiting Echo
- Criminals and cults

**Wild Sheep Chase + Frozen Sick:**

\page

### Narrative Connections

**References Between Adventures:**

**After Wolves of Welton:**
- Elric: "Awakened intelligence... fascinating. I wonder if other creatures are affected."
- Mara: "Heard from Pinebrook—they're having strange problems too."

**After Peril in Pinebrook:**
- Brenna: "Artifacts surfacing. Where are they coming from?"
- Elric: "These items are Aeorian in origin. Concerning."

**After Frozen Sick:**
- Elric: "Salsvault! I've found references. This changes everything."
- Brenna: "We need to act. The Echo is an existential threat."

**Before Temple:**
- Brenna: "Intelligence suggests a cult is exploiting the Echo. We must stop them."

\page

### NPC Development Across Adventures

**Elric's Research:**
- **Early:** "Detecting anomalies... very curious."
- **Mid:** "Pattern emerging. Ancient Aeorian magic."
- **Late:** "The Echo originates from Salsvault. We must act."

**Brenna's Concern:**
- **Early:** "Stay safe out there. Report anything unusual."
- **Mid:** "This is bigger than wolf attacks. Be careful."
- **Late:** "Northreach is at risk. I'm authorizing aggressive action."

**Mara's Intelligence:**
- **Early:** "Traders mention strange occurrences."
- **Mid:** "My sources say powerful people are taking interest."
- **Late:** "Word is, factions are mobilizing. Something big is happening."

\page

## Handling Skipped Adventures

### If Players Never Choose an Adventure

**That's Fine:**
- Not all adventures required
- Mystery still progresses
- Temple works as finale regardless

**What Happens to Skipped Threats:**
- **Wolves of Welton:** Village hires other adventurers, problem resolved off-screen
- **Peril in Pinebrook:** Sheriff eventually caught, artifacts seized by authorities
- **Frozen Sick:** Disease contained by quarantine (harsh but effective)
- **Wild Sheep Chase:** Noke finds another solution (or stays a sheep)

**Consequences:**
- Players miss Echo clues from that adventure
- NPCs might be less grateful
- Other wardens get credit

\page

### If Players Want to Return to Skipped Adventures

**Later in Campaign:**

**Allow it IF:**
- Threat still unresolved
- Players express interest
- Time permits

**Adjust for Level:**
- Scale encounters up
- Increase gold rewards
- Add complications (problem worsened)

\page

## Running Multiple Adventures Simultaneously

### Split Party

**If 5-6 Players:**
- Split into two groups
- One group: Wolves of Welton
- Other group: Peril in Pinebrook
- Resolve sequentially (not parallel)

**Benefits:**
- More content per session
- Players get spotlight
- Variable attendance easier

**Challenges:**
- More prep
- Splitting time fairly
- Tracking multiple storylines

\page

### Simultaneous Contracts

**If Players Want Multiple Contracts:**
- Choose 2 contracts
- Resolve one per session
- Other threat escalates while they're busy

**Creates Tension:**
- Time pressure
- Must prioritize
- Consequences for delay

**Example:**
- Take Wolves of Welton contract
- Frozen Sick outbreak happens mid-adventure
- Must finish Welton then rush to Palebank
- Disease worse because of delay

\page

## Pacing the Mystery

### Information Threshold

**By Adventure 2:**
- Players know something strange is happening
- Elric mentions "arcane anomalies"

**By Adventure 3-4:**
- Pattern recognized
- Term "Aeorian Echo" introduced
- Salsvault referenced

**By Adventure 5:**
- Echo's source known
- Factions exploiting it
- Urgency established

**Before Temple:**
- Full picture clear
- Must act or Northreach suffers

\page

### Adjusting Based on Player Investigation

**If Players Investigate Actively:**
- Accelerate revelations
- Elric shares more
- Add research scenes
- Reach full understanding by adventure 4

**If Players Focus on Contracts:**
- Slow revelations
- Mystery background element
- Reach full understanding by adventure 6

**If Players Ignore Mystery:**
- Eventually force confrontation (Temple)
- Still works, just less satisfying
- Last-minute revelation

\page

## Special Considerations

### Very Short Campaign (3-4 Sessions Total)

**Sequence:**
1. Open Skirmish (mandatory)
2. Frozen Sick (major revelation)
3. Temple of the Dragonknights (finale)

**Why:** Frontloads Echo, gets to climax fast, satisfying arc

\page

### Very Long Campaign (15+ Sessions)

**Sequence:**
1. Run all Season 1 adventures (6 adventures)
2. Add side quests between
3. Introduce Season 2 threats before finishing Season 1
4. Temple as Season 1 finale
5. Continue to Season 2

**Why:** Full experience, all content, natural expansion

\page

### Drop-In/Drop-Out Campaign

**Structure:**
- Each session is standalone contract
- No assumed continuity
- Recap at start of each session
- Order completely flexible

**Best Adventures for This:**
- Wild Sheep Chase (one-shot)
- Peril in Pinebrook (relatively self-contained)
- Wolves of Welton (clear beginning/end)

**Challenges:**
- Temple requires Echo knowledge (save for when regulars present)
- Frozen Sick long (split across multiple sessions)

\page

## Session Zero Planning

### Discuss with Players

**Questions:**
1. **Tone preference:** Serious vs. lighthearted?
2. **Challenge preference:** Combat, roleplay, or balanced?
3. **Mystery interest:** Do they want to investigate Echo actively?
4. **Campaign length:** 5 sessions? 10? 20?
5. **Attendance:** Regular or variable?

**Adjust sequencing based on answers.**

\page

## Final Recommendations

### For Most Tables

**Use this sequence:**
1. Open Skirmish (mandatory)
2. Wolves of Welton (teaches investigation)
3. Player choice (2-3 adventures)
4. Frozen Sick (revelation)
5. Temple of the Dragonknights (finale)

**Why:** Balanced, flexible, satisfying progression

\page

### Trust Player Agency

**Remember:**
- Players choosing contracts is core mechanic
- "Wrong" order doesn't exist
- Mystery works in any sequence
- Your job: make their choice matter

**The best sequence is the one your players create through their choices.**
