# Mystery Revelation Guide

*How to pace and reveal the Aeorian Echo mystery throughout the campaign*

\page

## The Core Mystery

**The Aeorian Echo** is ancient magical energy emanating from Salsvault, buried Aeorian ruins deep in Northreach's far north. This energy is:
- Awakening intelligence in animals
- Spreading magical diseases
- Activating dormant artifacts
- Destabilizing reality near its source
- Drawing the attention of multiple factions

**The Players' Journey:** Discovering the Echo's existence, nature, source, and implications across 5-10 sessions of modular adventures.

\page

## Design Philosophy

### Key Principles

**1. Gradual Discovery**
Players learn about the Echo piece by piece, not through exposition dumps.

**2. Order Independence**
Every adventure provides clues, but no single adventure is required. Players connect dots themselves.

**3. Player-Driven Investigation**
Reward curiosity and proactive research. Don't force revelations.

**4. Show, Don't Tell**
Let players experience effects before understanding causes.

**5. Mystery over Explanation**
The Echo should feel mysterious and dangerous, not fully explained until late in the campaign (or even Season 2).

\page

## Pacing the Revelations

### If Players are Proactive (Investigating Actively)

**Accelerate revelations:**
- Reward investigation with information
- Elric more forthcoming
- Additional clues available
- Reach Layer 3 by session 5-6

**Why:** Players driving the mystery deserve answers

\page

### If Players are Passive (Just Taking Contracts)

**Slow revelations:**
- Let clues accumulate naturally
- Elric provides gentle prompts
- Mystery remains background
- Reach Layer 3 by session 7-8

**Why:** Some groups prefer adventures over mystery. That's fine.

\page

### If Players Ignore the Mystery

**Absolutely fine:**
- Focus on individual adventures
- Mystery is backdrop, not requirement
- Eventually hits critical point (Temple)
- Can still be satisfying without deep investigation

**Why:** Not every group likes mysteries. The adventures work standalone.

\page

## Red Herrings and Player Theories

### Embrace Player Speculation

**Good DM Practice:**
- Let players theorize wildly
- Don't confirm or deny immediately
- Some theories might be better than your plan
- Consider incorporating good ideas

**Common Player Theories:**
- "The guild leadership is involved" (Elric might be, unintentionally)
- "Someone is causing this deliberately" (partially true—factions exploiting it)
- "It's a new god awakening" (not true, but sounds cool)
- "The wolves are the good guys" (maybe true in Wolves of Welton)

**How to Handle:**
- "That's an interesting theory. What makes you think that?"
- Use investigation skills to confirm/deny
- Let them discover truth through play

\page

### False Leads (Optional)

**If you want more complexity:**

**Red Herring 1: The Broker's Network**
- Mara's secret intelligence work could seem suspicious
- Players might think guild is compromised
- Actually: Mara is just gathering information
- Reveal: She's on their side, just has divided loyalty

**Red Herring 2: Elric's Research**
- His obsession might seem dangerous
- Players could fear he's making it worse
- Actually: He's just passionate, not reckless
- Reveal: He provides crucial information

**Red Herring 3: Ancient Conspiracy**
- Players might think Echo is intentional weapon
- Could suspect faction activated it deliberately
- Actually: Salsvault destabilized naturally over time
- Reveal: Everyone is reacting, no one caused it initially

\page

## Revelation Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't:

**1. Info Dump**
- Elric sitting players down for 20-minute lecture
- Long monologues explaining everything
- Handing out written treatise

**Instead:** Information emerges through investigation, NPCs responding to questions, environmental storytelling

\page

**2. Force Revelations**
- "You suddenly realize..."
- "As you research, you discover..."
- Taking agency from players

**Instead:** "You find evidence suggesting..." "What do you do with this information?" Let players decide to investigate

\page

**3. Hide Information Behind Single Check**
- Crucial clue only available on DC 20 Investigation
- Miss one check, miss entire layer of mystery

**Instead:** Multiple paths to same information. Failed check delays revelation, doesn't prevent it.

\page

**4. Require Specific Adventure Order**
- "You can't learn about Echo until you do Frozen Sick"
- Linear mystery structure

**Instead:** Every adventure provides pieces. Order doesn't matter.

\page

**5. Make Mystery Required**
- "You must investigate the Echo to succeed"
- Punish players for focusing on adventures

**Instead:** Mystery enhances campaign but isn't mandatory. Adventures work standalone.

\page

## Final Thoughts

The Aeorian Echo is a **backdrop, not the story.** The story is the wardens protecting Northreach, making hard choices, and growing as characters.

The mystery should:
- **Enhance** adventures (explain why threats are occurring)
- **Reward** curiosity (investigation yields understanding)
- **Build** tension (situation is worsening)
- **Connect** adventures (everything ties together)

But it should never **require** specific play style or **punish** players for focusing on adventures instead of investigation.

**Trust your players.** If they're investigating, feed them clues. If they're ignoring it, let the mystery simmer in the background. Either way, they'll eventually face the consequences in Temple of the Dragonknights.

**The mystery is a tool, not a railroad. Use it to enhance your campaign, not restrict it.**
