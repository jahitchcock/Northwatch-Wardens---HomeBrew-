# Encounter Scaling Guide

*How to adjust encounters for 2-5 players dynamically*

\page

## Core Philosophy

The Northwatch Wardens campaign is designed for **3-4 players**, but real tables have **variable attendance**. This guide helps you scale encounters on the fly without extensive prep.

**Key Principle:** It's better to adjust during combat than to perfectly balance beforehand.

\page

## Quick Reference Table

| Party Size | Adjustment | Method |
|------------|------------|--------|
| **2 players** | Reduce 40% | Remove enemies, lower HP, reduce damage |
| **3 players** | Reduce 20% | Remove 1 enemy or lower HP slightly |
| **4 players** | As written | No changes needed |
| **5 players** | Increase 30% | Add 1-2 enemies or increase HP |
| **6 players** | Increase 50% | Add 2-3 enemies, increase HP/damage |

\page

## Scaling Methods

### Method 1: Adjust Enemy Count (Easiest)

**2 Players:**
- Remove 40% of enemies (round down)
- 5 goblins → 3 goblins
- 6 wolves → 4 wolves

**3 Players:**
- Remove 20% of enemies (round down)
- 5 goblins → 4 goblins
- 6 wolves → 5 wolves

**5 Players:**
- Add 30% more enemies (round up)
- 5 goblins → 7 goblins
- 6 wolves → 8 wolves

**6 Players:**
- Add 50% more enemies (round up)
- 5 goblins → 8 goblins
- 6 wolves → 9 wolves

\page

### Method 2: Adjust Hit Points (More Precise)

**2 Players:**
- Reduce enemy HP by 40%
- Wolf (11 HP) → 7 HP
- Bandit (11 HP) → 7 HP
- Ogre (59 HP) → 35 HP

**3 Players:**
- Reduce enemy HP by 20%
- Wolf (11 HP) → 9 HP
- Bandit (11 HP) → 9 HP
- Ogre (59 HP) → 47 HP

**5 Players:**
- Increase enemy HP by 30%
- Wolf (11 HP) → 14 HP
- Bandit (11 HP) → 14 HP
- Ogre (59 HP) → 77 HP

**6 Players:**
- Increase enemy HP by 50%
- Wolf (11 HP) → 17 HP
- Bandit (11 HP) → 17 HP
- Ogre (59 HP) → 89 HP

\page

### Method 3: Adjust Damage (Fine-Tuning)

**If encounter is too deadly even after HP adjustment:**

**2-3 Players:**
- Reduce damage dice by one step
- 1d8+2 → 1d6+2
- 2d6+3 → 2d4+3

**5-6 Players:**
- Increase damage dice by one step
- 1d6+2 → 1d8+2
- 2d4+3 → 2d6+3

\page

### Method 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Combine methods for best results:**

**2 Players:**
- Remove 1-2 enemies
- Reduce remaining enemies' HP by 20%

**3 Players:**
- Remove 1 enemy OR reduce all HP by 10%

**5 Players:**
- Add 1 enemy OR increase all HP by 20%

**6 Players:**
- Add 1-2 enemies
- Increase HP by 20%

\page

## Dynamic Scaling (During Combat)

### If Combat is Too Easy

**Round 2-3 options:**

1. **Reinforce**ments arrive
   > "You hear howls in the distance. Three more wolves emerge from the tree line."

2. **Enemies get tactical**
   - Use cover more effectively
   - Focus fire on one target
   - Grapple or shove instead of just attacking

3. **Boss gets serious**
   - Use stronger abilities
   - Call for help
   - Reveal hidden power (legendary action, extra attack)

4. **Environmental hazard**
   - Fire spreads
   - Ceiling starts to collapse
   - Water level rising

\page

### If Combat is Too Hard

**Any round options:**

1. **Enemies flee**
   > "The bandits, seeing their leader fall, break and run for the forest."

2. **Reinforcements arrive (for PCs)**
   - Brenna or other warden shows up
   - Friendly NPC provides support
   - Town guards arrive

3. **Enemy morale breaks**
   - Surrender after leader dies
   - Flee at half strength
   - Negotiate or beg for mercy

4. **Subtle HP reduction**
   - Enemies go down with less damage than stat block suggests
   - "That blow catches him in the throat. He crumples."

5. **Environmental advantage**
   - Cover appears (wagon tips over)
   - Escape route revealed
   - Healing items found

- Can't die without narrative reason

**Recommended NPCs:**

### Option 4: Radical Scaling

**Adjust encounters dramatically:**

**Works if:**
- Player prefers narrative over combat

- [ ] How many players expected?
- [ ] Party level vs. adventure level

- [ ] Which encounters might need scaling
- [ ] Backup reinforcements prepared (NPCs, extra enemies)
- [ ] Emergency healing options (potions, NPC healer)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Preparing

**Problem:** Preparing separate versions of every encounter for every party size

**Solution:** Use quick adjustments during play. Encounter balance is rough, not precise.

\page

### Mistake 2: Scaling Linearly

**Problem:** Doubling enemies for double the players

**Solution:** Action economy matters more than raw numbers. A 6-player party needs 50% more challenge, not 100%.

\page

### Mistake 3: Never Adjusting

**Problem:** "The dice fall where they may"

**Solution:** Unfair difficulty isn't fun. Adjust to create challenge, not frustration.

\page

### Mistake 4: Scaling Everything

**Problem:** Scaling even trivial encounters

**Solution:** Some encounters should be easy. Not every fight needs balance.

\page

### Mistake 5: Hiding Adjustments

**Problem:** Never admitting to players you're adjusting

**Solution:** Transparency is fine. "You guys are crushing this. Two more bandits rush in from the back room." Players appreciate adaptive DMing.

\page

## Advanced Technique: Wave Combat

**For large parties (5-6 players):**

Instead of flooding the field with enemies, use **waves:**

**Example: Bandit Camp**

**Wave 1 (Round 1):** 4 bandits engage
**Wave 2 (Round 3):** 3 more bandits join from tents
**Wave 3 (Round 5):** Bandit captain emerges

**Benefits:**
- Easier to track
- Creates narrative flow
- Adjustable (skip Wave 3 if players are struggling)
- Feels dynamic and cinematic

\page

## Environmental Scaling

**Terrain can balance encounters without changing stat blocks:**

### For Small Parties (2-3 players)

**Add:**
- Cover (half cover bonus to AC)
- Chokepoints (limit enemy access)
- Elevation (high ground advantage)
- Escape routes (strategic retreat option)

\page

### For Large Parties (5-6 players)

**Add:**
- Open ground (enemies can surround)
- Hazards (lava, pits, falling rocks)
- Objectives (protect NPC, retrieve item while fighting)
- Time pressure (enemies reinforcing, building burning)

## Final Thoughts

**Encounter scaling is an art, not a science.**

Your goals:
1. **Challenge** players without overwhelming them
2. **Adapt** to unexpected situations
3. **Maintain** narrative consistency
4. **Ensure** everyone has fun

**Remember:**
- Start conservative (err on easier side)
- Adjust up during combat (easier than adjusting down)
- Watch player engagement (bored = too easy, frustrated = too hard)
- Trust your instincts

**The best encounter is the one where:**
- Players use strategy and tactics
- Success feels earned
- Some danger exists but isn't overwhelming
- Everyone at the table is engaged

**Don't stress about perfect balance. Stress about player fun.**
