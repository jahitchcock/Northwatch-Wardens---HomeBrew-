## Loot Balance

**Don't Worry Too Much:**
- Northreach is low-magic setting
- Focus on story rewards
- Magic items rare and special
- Gold useful but not excessive

**Avoid:**
- Huge gold hoards (breaks economy)
- Too many magic items (ruins tone)
- Overpowering party (ruins encounters)

**Perfect Balance:** Players feel rewarded but not overpowered
