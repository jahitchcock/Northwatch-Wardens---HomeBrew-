# Northwatch Wardens: DM Session Prep Guide

## Quick Reference: Campaign Flow & Cohesion

### ✅ Campaign DOES Flow Well Because:

1. **Strong Narrative Thread** - The "Aeorian Echo" connects all adventures
2. **Clear Structure** - Guild hub (Waystone Inn) provides natural session start/end points
3. **Recurring NPCs** - Guild leadership appears throughout, creating continuity
4. **Escalating Threat** - Magic corruption spreads from Welton → Palebank → Temple
5. **Flexible Pacing** - Adventures can be played in different orders (except Frozen Sick should come before Temple)

### 🎯 What You Already Have:

- ✅ **9 recurring NPCs** with personalities, secrets, and campaign ties
- ✅ **53 encounters** with multiple resolution paths
- ✅ **Clear geography** - Waystone Inn as hub, 6 satellite locations
- ✅ **Thematic consistency** - Frontier survival, moral choices, magical corruption
- ✅ **Built-in session hooks** - Contracts from Marshal Brenna Thorne

## Session Recap System

### Option 1: Player-Led Recap (RECOMMENDED)

**At start of each session:**

1. **"Last time on Northwatch Wardens..."** - Ask players:
   - "What happened last session?"
   - "What did your character learn?"
   - "What's your character worried about?"

2. **DM adds what they forgot** - Fill in 1-2 key details

**Why this works:**
- Players engage more when they recap
- You learn what they care about
- Shows what they remember vs. what they missed

### Option 2: DM Recap Template

Use this if players are new or struggling:

```
LAST SESSION RECAP:
• Where: [Location]
• Quest: [Contract/Goal]
• What happened: [2-3 key events]
• Clue discovered: [Aeorian Echo hint]
• Current status: [Where they are now]
```

---

## Session Opening Template

### Every Session Starts at Waystone Inn

**Session 0: Charter Signing** (covered in xml)

**Session 1+:**

```
MORNING AT WAYSTONE INN:

[Weather/Atmosphere]
The common room of Waystone Inn smells of bacon and woodsmoke. 
[Returning party gets hero's welcome OR new arrivals get curious looks]

GUILD BUSINESS:
• Report contract results to Marshal Brenna (if returning)
• Receive payment from Steward Mara
• Get intelligence briefing from Lorewarden Elric
• New contract offered (or rumor/NPC approach)

CHOICE POINT:
"What do you do?"
```

**This creates natural rhythm:**
- Downtime → Briefing → Adventure → Return → Repeat

---

## Between-Session Continuity Tracking

### Keep This Simple Document

```markdown
## Northwatch Wardens: Campaign Tracker

**Current Date:** [In-game date]
**Party Level:** [1-5]
**Contracts Completed:** [List]

### Important Choices Made:
- Wolves of Welton: [Killed/Negotiated/Compromised]
- Frozen Sick: [Who got cured? Urgon? Tulgi?]
- Temple: [Venomfang killed/fled/negotiated?]

### NPCs Met & Reputation:
- Marshal Brenna: [Trusts party / Neutral / Suspicious]
- Father Merriksonn: [If Welton resolved peacefully, he's grateful]
- Captain Kole: [If Pinebrook completed]

### Aeorian Echo Clues Discovered:
- [ ] Wolves awakened by sorcerer's death (magical feedback)
- [ ] Palebank plague caused by Aeorian relic
- [ ] Salsvault still active and leaking magic
- [ ] Temple cult drawn to magical disturbance
- [ ] Elric suspects "arcane engine beneath Northreach"

### Unfinished Business:
- [Note anything party said they'd return to]
```

## Session Zero: Critical Setup

### Player Character Ties to Waystone Inn

**Ask each player:**

> "Why did your character join the Northwatch Wardens?"

**Suggested Answers:**
- Hired by Marshal Brenna after proving themselves
- Rescued by Wardens, now repaying debt
- Seeking purpose after loss/trauma
- Frontier native, wants to protect home
- Outsider seeking fresh start
- Recommended by another Warden (NPC or absent PC)

**Result:** Every PC has reason to return to Waystone Inn between adventures

### Establish Ground Rules

1. **West Marches Style Play:**
   - Adventures are modular (can skip sessions without breaking story)
   - Party composition can change between contracts
   - Waystone Inn is constant hub

2. **Advancement:**
   - **RECOMMENDED:** Milestone leveling (level up after each major adventure)
   - Level 1 → 2: After Wolves of Welton
   - Level 2 → 3: After Frozen Sick OR Temple
   - Level 3 → 4: After completing 2 major adventures
   - Level 4 → 5: After Temple of Dragonknights

3. **Tone Expectations:**
   - Grounded, low-magic frontier
   - Moral choices matter
   - Combat is dangerous (no guaranteed wins)
   - Investigation and social encounters are equally important

---

## Adventure Order Recommendations

### Flexible Order (Players Choose):

**Level 1-2 Adventures:**
- Wolves of Welton (GREAT starter - teaches negotiation)
- Peril in Pinebrook (investigation-heavy, shorter)

**Level 2-3 Adventures:**
- Frozen Sick (reveals Aeorian Echo explicitly)
- Wild Sheep Chase (comic relief, can slot anywhere)

**Level 3-5 Adventures:**
- Temple of Dragonknights (campaign capstone, best done last)

### Recommended Story Order:

1. **Wolves of Welton** (Level 1-2)
   - Introduces magical corruption theme
   - Teaches players moral complexity

2. **Wild Sheep Chase** (Level 2-3) 
   - Comic relief after serious adventure
   - Can be random encounter near Waystone

3. **Frozen Sick** (Level 2-3)
   - REVEALS Aeorian Echo directly
   - Sets up Salsvault as "source"
   - Best before Temple

4. **Peril in Pinebrook** (Level 2-3)
   - Can slot anywhere
   - Reinforces "frontier fragility" theme

5. **Temple of Dragonknights** (Level 3-5)
   - Cult drawn by magical disturbances
   - Epic finale
   - Venomfang as major threat

## DM Preparation Per Session

### 1 Week Before Session:

- [ ] Review next adventure from XML
- [ ] Read NPC descriptions for any appearing this session
- [ ] Note 2-3 ways players could surprise you
- [ ] Prepare 1 "Aeorian Echo clue" to drop

### Day of Session:

- [ ] Re-read last session's notes
- [ ] Review encounter UIDs you'll use
- [ ] Print/bookmark stat blocks you need
- [ ] Prepare opening scene at Waystone Inn
- [ ] Have backup quest ready if players go off-script

### During Session:

**Track:**
- Important player choices
- NPCs met and player reactions
- Aeorian Echo clues discovered
- XP earned (if using XP) or milestones hit
- Any promises party made ("We'll come back for...")

### After Session:

- [ ] Update Campaign Tracker document
- [ ] Note what worked well / what didn't
- [ ] Write 1-sentence recap for next session opening
- [ ] Level up characters if milestone reached

---

## When Players Miss Sessions

### West Marches Solution:

**Missing player's PC:**
- "Is assigned a different contract by Marshal Brenna"
- OR "Takes a day off at Waystone Inn"
- OR "Is scouting ahead / gathering intel"

**Returning player:**
- Gets brief recap from other players
- "Marshal Brenna updates you on what happened"
- Rejoins at Waystone Inn for next contract

**This prevents:**
- "Why did my character vanish mid-dungeon?"
- Story breaking from inconsistent party

---

## Handling Player Choices That Break Campaign

### If Players Refuse All Contracts:

**Brenna's Response:**
> "You're Wardens. This is the job. If you don't want it, turn in your badges. But understand: these threats don't go away because you ignore them."

**Then show consequences:**
- Welton gets overrun by wolves (refugees arrive at Waystone)
- Palebank plague spreads (infected travelers show up)
- Temple cult grows stronger (rumors of dragon attacks)

### If Players Kill Important NPCs:

**Examples:**
- Kill Bolt (wolf negotiator): Flame takes over, attacks escalate
- Kill Marshal Brenna: Steward Mara takes over, guild becomes more cautious
- Kill Father Merriksonn: Welton becomes hostile to outsiders

**Philosophy:** Actions have consequences, but campaign continues

---

## Improvisation Toolkit

### When Players Go Off-Script:

**You have these tools:**
- **9 NPCs** - Any can approach party with information
- **6 Locations** - Can drop random encounter at any
- **Wild Sheep Chase** - Can trigger anywhere, anytime
- **Elric's Research** - Can provide lore dump if players are lost

### Random Encounter Table (1d6):

1. **Merchant caravan** from Pinebrook, wants escort to Waystone
2. **Wounded traveler** from Welton, reports trouble
3. **Mysterious sheep** (Shinebright, starts Wild Sheep Chase)
4. **Winter storm** (forces shelter, roleplay opportunity)
5. **Bandits** (2d4 bandits, CR 1/8 each)
6. **Aeorian anomaly** (magical effect: blue glow, temperature drop, animals acting strange)

## What You DON'T Need

### ❌ Don't Worry About:

- **Detailed maps** - Theater of mind works for most encounters
- **Perfect stat blocks** - Use approximations, adjust on the fly
- **Every NPC voice** - Consistent personality > accent
- **Rigid timeline** - Adventures are episodic, not time-critical
- **Balanced encounters** - 5e is forgiving, and you have scaling notes

### ✅ Instead Focus On:

- **Player choices mattering** - Remember what they decide
- **NPCs reacting to party reputation** - Did they help Welton? People remember
- **Aeorian Echo building** - Drop 1 hint per session
- **Making Waystone Inn feel like home** - Describe it consistently, NPCs greet by name

---

## Emergency DM Moves

### Party is Stuck:

1. **Elric sends research notes** (clue delivery)
2. **NPC approaches with information** (guide them)
3. **Brenna calls them back** ("I have new intel for you")

### Party is Dying:

1. **Mysterious helper** (Elric was following, uses magic to help)
2. **Enemy retreats** ("You're not worth killing" - villain leaves)
3. **Captured instead of killed** (wake up as prisoners, now must escape)

### Players Are Bored:

1. **Ambush NOW** (bandits, wolves, or random encounter)
2. **NPC betrayal** (someone they trust isn't trustworthy)
3. **Sheep appears** (start Wild Sheep Chase immediately)

---
