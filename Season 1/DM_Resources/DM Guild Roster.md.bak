**⭐ LEADERSHIP**

**Marshal Brenna Thorne — Field Commander**

<img src="../Campaign%20Assets/Images/MarshalBrennaThorne.jpg" width="90" alt="Marshal Brenna Thorne" style="display: block;" />

**Public Face:** A hardened ranger who has spent decades patrolling the Northreach frontier.
**Private Truth:** Brenna once served alongside **Corel of Welton** during the “Greywinter Hunts,” a brutal season when wolves, undead, and worse spilled out of the northern woods. She carries guilt for losing half her squad—including her younger brother—to a creature she never identified.

**Campaign Tie‑ins:**

- Wolves of Welton: Brenna recognizes the wolf behavior as wrong and quietly suspects magical influence. She will push the party to investigate thoroughly, not just kill wolves.
- Frozen Sick: Brenna has seen strange diseases before and will immediately recognize the blue-vein symptoms as unnatural.
- Wild Sheep Chase: Brenna once met Shinebright decades ago; she remembers him as brilliant but arrogant. She will be deeply suspicious of any magical mishap involving him.

**Secret:** Brenna has a sealed letter from an Uthodurn contact warning of “arcane disturbances” across the frontier. This is your campaign‑wide foreshadowing.

**Steward Mara Fenwick — Quartermaster**

**Public Face:** A cheerful, meticulous human woman who runs supplies, finances, and logistics.
