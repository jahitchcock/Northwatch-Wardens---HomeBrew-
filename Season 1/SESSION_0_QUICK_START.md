## Waystone Inn: Your Guild Headquarters

**Location:** In the wilderness between several frontier settlements  
**Description:** A two-story stone inn with a watchtower, stable, and reinforced walls. The common room serves as the guild hall, with a contract board by the fireplace.

**Key Features:**
- **The Contract Board** — Where missions are posted
- **The Long Table** — Where the charter will be signed
- **Private Rooms** — Wardens get free lodging
- **The Tower** — Elric's study and observation post

**Atmosphere:** Smells of woodsmoke and hearth bread, sounds of crackling fire and wind outside, feeling of safety in a dangerous wilderness.

## The Northwatch Wardens Charter (Condensed)

**Read this aloud during the signing ceremony:**

> *"The Northwatch Wardens are founded to safeguard the frontier settlements of Northreach. We stand against threats both mundane and arcane. We protect the innocent, honor our contracts, and share vital information with fellow Wardens.*
> 
> *Membership is open to all competent individuals who take the oath. Contracts are posted at Waystone Inn and include monster suppression, escorts, investigations, and diplomacy.*
> 
> *We are led by a council of three: Marshal, Steward, and Lorewarden. The Waystone Inn serves as our guildhall and safehouse.*
> 
> *Sign below to become a Warden."*

**The Oath (Players Repeat After You):**

> *"I stand with the Wardens. I protect the innocent. I honor my contracts. I stand against corruption, mortal or magical. Where the frontier needs me, I will answer."*

**After Signing:** Brenna hands each player a **Northwatch Wardens badge** (silver with a compass rose). "Welcome to the Wardens. Now let's get to work."

## Running Session 0 (2-Hour Timeline)

### Hour 1: Setup & Characters (60 minutes)

**0:00–0:15 — Welcome & Campaign Pitch**
- Introduce yourself and the campaign (use elevator pitch above)
- Set expectations:
  - Modular adventures (can miss sessions without breaking story)
  - Moral choices matter (not everything is solved by combat)
  - Variable attendance is fine (characters can rotate between contracts)
  
**0:15–0:45 — Character Creation**
- **Option A:** Use premade characters (`Premade PCs/` folder)
- **Option B:** Build characters together (Standard Array or Point Buy)
- **Option C:** Players bring their own level 1 characters

**Important:** Ask each player: *"Why did your character join the Northwatch Wardens?"*
- Suggested answers: Hired for skill, seeking purpose, protecting home, fresh start, recommended by friend

**0:45–1:00 — Ground Rules**
- **Advancement:** Milestone leveling (level up after major adventures)
- **Tone:** Grounded frontier, combat is dangerous, investigation matters
- **Scheduling:** Confirm session frequency and handle absences

### Hour 2: The First Session (60 minutes)

**1:00–1:15 — Opening Scene**

*Read aloud:*

> *"Dawn breaks over Northreach. You stand outside the Waystone Inn, a fortified stone roadhouse in the wilderness. Smoke rises from its chimney. Inside, the common room is warm and smells of bacon and woodsmoke.*
> 
> *Three figures wait by a long wooden table: a gruff ranger woman in worn leathers, a cheerful halfling sorting papers, and a tall elven mage with calculating eyes.*
> 
> *This is where your story begins."*

Introduce the three NPCs briefly (use descriptions on page 2).

**1:15–1:30 — Charter Signing Ceremony**
- Brenna explains the guild's purpose (1 minute)
- Players sign the charter (use text on page 3)
- Players recite the oath together
- Brenna hands out badges

**1:30–1:45 — Meet the Guild**
- Let players ask questions of the three NPCs
- Mara gives them a tour (common room, bunks, tower)
- Elric mentions "strange disturbances" in the frontier
- Brenna says "We have work already"

**1:45–2:00 — The First Contract**

Brenna gestures to the contract board. One parchment is pinned there with a wolf-tooth charm.

*Read aloud:*

> **CONTRACT W-17: "Wolves of Welton"**
> 
> *Client:* Welton Village Council  
> *Reward:* 800 gp + provisions  
> *Urgency:* High
> 
> *"A pack of unusually aggressive wolves has been attacking shepherds and stealing livestock. The wolves are coordinated and have outsmarted our hunting parties. Request immediate assistance from capable Wardens."*

**Brenna's Briefing:**
- "Welton's a half-day's ride south. Good people, hard winter."
- "Wolves have been hitting farms. Coordinated attacks, almost like they're being led."
- "This is exactly what we're here for. You ready for your first contract?"

**End Session (Choose One):**

**Option A: End with Preparation**
- Players accept the contract
- Mara packs them supplies
- "You prepare to leave at dawn."
- **Next session starts with the journey to Welton**

**Option B: Combat Encounter (Add 30-45 minutes)**
- Players accept the contract
- As night falls, wolves attack the inn (see "Session 0 Combat" below)
- After defeating the wolves, notice strange blue veins in their fur
- "Something's affecting the wildlife. We leave at dawn."
- **Next session starts with the journey to Welton**

## Session 0 Combat (Optional)

**Use this if you want to add a 30-45 minute combat encounter to Session 0.**

### Wolves at the Waystone Inn

**Setup:** After the charter signing, as dusk settles, hungry wolves attack the inn.

**Read Aloud:**

> *The wind picks up outside as darkness falls. You're settling in when Brenna suddenly raises a hand.*
> 
> *"Everyone quiet. Listen."*
> 
> *Through the howling wind, you hear it: a low, rattling growl. Then another. The lanterns outside flicker.*
> 
> *"Wolves," Brenna says grimly. "Close the shutters. Weapons ready."*
> 
> *Before you can react, two gaunt wolves burst through the half-open door, eyes wild with hunger and something else—blue veins pulsing faintly beneath their matted fur. They're starving, desperate, and clearly sick.*

### Encounter Details

**Enemies:** 2 Wolves (CR 1/4 each)  
**Party:** Level 1 characters (2-5 players)

**Wolf Modifications (Echo Sickness):**
- Normal wolf stats
- Appearance: Gaunt, blue-tinged veins visible in fur
- Behavior: More aggressive than normal, don't flee as readily
- If reduced to 0 HP, body shows signs of arcane corruption (blue veins glow briefly before fading)

**Terrain:**
- **Waystone Inn common room** — tables, chairs, fireplace
- **Half cover** — Behind tables and bar
- **Difficult terrain** — Knocked-over chairs
- **Hazard** — Fireplace (creatures pushed into it take 1d6 fire damage)

**Tactics:**
- Wolves prioritize nearest target
- Use Pack Tactics if possible
- Fight to the death (they're too sick/hungry to flee)

### After Combat

**Investigation (Optional):**
- DC 12 Medicine check: "These wolves aren't just starving. Something's wrong with them."
- DC 10 Arcana check: "Faint traces of magical energy, like residual spellwork."

**NPC Reactions:**

**Brenna:** "In twenty years on the frontier, I've never seen wolves attack a lit inn like that. Something drove them mad."

**Elric:** (Examining a body) "Curious. These veins... arcane corruption. Minor, but present. The frontier's changing."

**Mara:** "I'll get a healer's kit. Everyone alright?" (Provides free healing kit use if needed)

**Connection to Campaign:**
- First hint of the Aeorian Echo affecting wildlife
- Shows that the frontier is becoming more dangerous
- Makes the Wolves of Welton contract feel urgent and connected

## Player Character Creation Tips

### Recommended Character Aspects

**Backgrounds That Fit:**
- Folk Hero, Outlander, Soldier, Guild Artisan, Sage, Acolyte

**Motivations That Work:**
- Protect your homeland
- Seek purpose after tragedy
- Earn coin for family
- Investigate frontier mysteries
- Atone for past mistakes

**Party Composition (Suggested):**
- At least 1 character with combat skills
- At least 1 character with social skills (Persuasion, Insight)
- At least 1 character with wilderness skills (Survival, Nature)

**What to Avoid:**
- Lone wolf characters who refuse to cooperate (this is a guild campaign)
- Characters with no connection to the frontier (hard to justify joining)

---

## After Session 0: What's Next?

### Before Session 1:
- [ ] Read **Wolves of Welton** adventure (`Season 1/Adventures/Wolves_Of_Welton/5E_Wolves_Of_Welton.md`)
- [ ] Review encounter locations and NPCs
- [ ] Prepare battle maps (or use theater of the mind)

### Optional Deeper Prep (After Session 0):
- Read `Season 1/README.md` for full campaign overview
- Read `Season 1/DM_Resources/Session_Prep_Guide.md` for advanced DM tips
- Review `Season 1/DM_Resources/DM Guild Roster.md` for NPC secrets

### Running Future Sessions:
Every session follows this pattern:
1. **Return to Waystone Inn** — Report contract results, get paid
2. **Briefing** — New contract offered or players choose from board
3. **Adventure** — Complete the contract
4. **Return** — Repeat cycle

---

## Quick Reference: Key Locations

| Location | Description | Used In |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Waystone Inn** | Guild HQ, mission hub | Every session |
| **Welton** | Farming village, half-day south | First adventure |
| **Pinebrook** | Trading village, southeast | Optional adventure |
| **Palebank Village** | Seaside settlement, northeast | Optional adventure |
| **Temple of Dragonknights** | Cult stronghold, northwest mountains | Capstone adventure |

## Troubleshooting Session 0

**Q: Players want to go straight to combat?**  
A: Save combat for Session 1. Session 0 is about setup. Tease danger: "The wolves are out there. You'll face them soon."

**Q: Players want detailed world lore?**  
A: Keep it brief. "This is the cold frontier of Northreach. Civilization is thin. Threats are real. You'll learn more as you explore."

**Q: Players don't want to join a guild?**  
A: Explain this is a guild campaign — it's the structure. If they're uncomfortable, they can be "probationary members" for the first contract.

**Q: Only 2 players show up?**  
A: Perfect! This campaign scales for 2–5 players. Smaller parties get tighter, more tactical encounters.

**Q: Players miss Session 0?**  
A: No problem. They can join Session 1 as "new recruits" arriving at Waystone Inn. Give them the 30-second pitch and hand them a badge.
