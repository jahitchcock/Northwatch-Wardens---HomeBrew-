# Northwatch Wardens — Drop-In Guild Campaign

## Overview
**Northwatch Wardens** is a **modular, drop-in guild campaign** for D&D 5e set in the frontier region of Northreach. Designed for **2–5 players per session**, it emphasizes **contract-based adventure** unified by a single overarching mystery: the **Aeorian Echo**, a spreading wave of arcane disturbance awakening magic and corruption across the frontier.

The campaign is **order-independent** — each adventure stands alone while building toward revealed connections. Perfect for variable attendance, rotating groups, and flexible scheduling.

- **Format**: Markdown adventure guides + JSON stat blocks + GM5e XML compendium
- **Campaign Hub**: Waystone Inn (guild headquarters)
- **Leadership**: Marshal Brenna Thorne, Steward Mara Fenwick, Lorewarden Elric Vael
- **Playstyle**: Contract posting → investigation → resolution → cryptic lore revealed

## How It Works
**Each session:**
1. Party gathers at Waystone Inn (existing or new Wardens)
2. Reviews contract postings on the board
3. Takes one contract (or completes an ongoing one)
4. Returns with findings and rewards
5. Receives cryptic hints connecting to the larger mystery

**No campaign history required.** Drop in any session, any party size, any adventure.

## The Aeorian Echo: Core Mystery

All adventures connect to a single spreading phenomenon: **arcane magic from buried Aeorian ruins (Salsvault, far north) is destabilizing the frontier**. No single adventure reveals the full picture; each provides clues.

**Progression of revelation (regardless of play order):**
1. **Wolves of Welton** — Intelligence awakening (first symptom)
2. **Frozen Sick** — Source discovered (Aeorian spores/active Salsvault)
3. **Temple of the Dragonknights** — Factions exploiting the magic (cult + Venomfang)
4. **Wild Sheep Chase** — Magic destabilizing everywhere (wand malfunction, Shinebright's transformation)
5. **Peril in Pinebrook** — Frontier fragility exposed (community in crossfire)

## Session Prep Checklist

### Before Each Session
1. **Pick an adventure** — Choose based on party level or let players select from posted contracts
2. **Review adventure secrets** — Check `Adventure_Secrets_Quick_Reference.md` for relevant world secrets
3. **Review the NPC secrets** — Check `DM Guild Roster.md` for relevant character motivations
4. **Note the mystery clue** — Each adventure hints at the Aeorian Echo; decide what party discovers
5. **Scale for party size** — 2 players = tighter encounters; 5 players = add reinforcements
6. **Prepare battle maps** — Use markdown descriptions or generate tactical maps externally

### Before Campaign Start
1. **Read the Campaign Arc** — Understand how adventures interlock (`NORTHWATCH WARDENS - Campaign Arc.md`)
2. **Review Adventure Secrets** — Familiarize with the connection system (`Adventure_Secrets_Quick_Reference.md`)
3. **Familiarize yourself** — Review charter, leadership, and NPCs
4. **Decide play order** — Adventures are order-independent; many DMs start with Wolves of Welton
5. **Import or reference** — Load XML into GM5e or use markdown + JSON files directly

---

## Design Principles

- **Order-independent**: No adventure depends on prior completion; each stands alone
- **Variable party size**: Adventures scale for 2–5 players per session
- **Drop-in friendly**: New players can join anytime with new or returning characters
- **Mystery-driven**: Each adventure provides clues; reveal the Aeorian Echo on your schedule
- **Consequence-rich**: Player choices echo across NPCs and settlements
- **Moral complexity**: Multiple resolution paths; no single "right" answer
- **Frontier atmosphere**: Low magic, grounded, but with arcane mysteries lurking

---

## Campaign Themes

- **The frontier is awakening** — Magic long buried is rising and destabilizing everything
- **Local problems reflect global threats** — Symptoms of the Aeorian Echo manifest differently in each location
- **Communities are resilient but fragile** — Small choices impact entire settlements
- **Intelligence and agency** — Even monsters can think, negotiate, and plan
- **Power corrupts** — Cults, dragons, and ambitious NPCs seek to exploit magic for dominance

---

## How the Mystery Unfolds

With each adventure, reveal more about the Aeorian Echo. Example progression:

**Session 1 (Wolves)**: "Why are wolves suddenly intelligent?"
→ *Answer*: Magical energy from somewhere is awakening things.

**Session 2 (Frozen Sick)**: "What is this plague? Where does it come from?"
→ *Answer*: Aeorian spores from an active ruin to the far north.

**Session 3 (Temple)**: "Why are cults and dragons moving now?"
→ *Answer*: They sense rising magic and want to exploit it.

**Session 4 (Sheep Chase)**: "Why are magical items failing?"
→ *Answer*: The entire arcane fabric of the region is destabilizing.

**Session 5 (Pinebrook)**: "Is the whole frontier affected?"
→ *Answer*: Yes. Every settlement will eventually feel this change.

---

## Running for Variable Attendance

### Player Continuity
- **New players join**: They're new Wardens arriving at Waystone Inn. No backstory required.
- **Recurring characters**: Maintain a shared roster so regulars can bring their Warden back
- **Solo adventurers**: A single PC runs normally; encounters just become tighter
- **Large groups**: Add reinforcements (more monsters, tougher boss tactics)

### Session Length Guidance
- **2-hour session**: Complete one encounter or short combat
- **3-4 hour session**: Full adventure or multi-scene encounter
- **One-shots**: Wild Sheep Chase is perfect; Wolves can be shortened

### Scalable Encounters
- Each adventure includes guidance for adjusting CR and encounter size
- JSON stat blocks note "minion" variants for swarms
- Recommended: Add 1 extra monster per additional PC beyond 3
