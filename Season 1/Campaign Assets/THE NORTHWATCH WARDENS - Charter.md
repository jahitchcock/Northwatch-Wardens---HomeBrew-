**THE NORTHWATCH WARDENS**

***Guild Charter***

*Ratified in the Year of the Frostwane Moon, at the Waystone Inn, Northreach Frontier*

**Article I — Purpose**

The Northwatch Wardens exist to:

- safeguard the frontier settlements of Northreach
- investigate threats mundane and arcane
- provide aid to travelers and townsfolk
- maintain peace along the wild roads and frozen forests
- respond swiftly to emerging dangers where local forces cannot

The Wardens are not a standing army, but a fellowship of capable individuals who volunteer their blades, spells, and skills for the good of the frontier.

**Article II — Membership**

Membership is open to any individual who:

- demonstrates competence in arms, magic, or wilderness craft
- swears to uphold the safety of Northreach
- agrees to abide by the Guild Code
- completes at least one sanctioned contract

Members may come and go as their lives demand. Absence does not forfeit membership, but dereliction of duty may.

**Article III — The Guild Code**

All Wardens shall:

# 1. Protect the innocent
# 2. Honor their contracts
# 3. Share vital information with fellow Wardens
# 4. Respect the frontier’s people, land, and traditions
# 5. Stand against corruption, mortal or magical
# 6. Never abandon a companion unless retreat is the only path to survival

Violation of the Code may result in suspension, exile, or—if necessary—judgment by the full council.

**Article IV — Contracts & Duties**

Wardens may accept contracts posted on the **Waystone Board**, including:

- monster suppression
- escort missions
- investigation of strange events
- recovery of lost persons or items
- diplomatic errands
- wilderness scouting

Payment is distributed fairly among participating Wardens. A portion (10%) supports guild operations and emergency funds.

**Article V — Leadership**

The Guild is overseen by a **Triad Council**, consisting of:

- a Marshal (operations & combat readiness)
- a Steward (logistics, supplies, finances)
- a Lorewarden (knowledge, magic, investigations)

Decisions require at least two signatures. In emergencies, any council member may issue a provisional order.

**Article VI — Sanctuary**

The Waystone Inn serves as:

- guildhall
- safehouse
- meeting place
- emergency shelter

All Wardens are entitled to:

- a bunk
- a hot meal
- basic medical attention
- access to guild records

**Article VII — Amendments**

This charter may be amended by a majority vote of active Wardens present at a sanctioned gathering.
