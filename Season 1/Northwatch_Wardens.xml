Brenna carries guilt from the Greywinter Hunts, where she lost half her squad including her younger brother to an unidentified creature. She recognizes danger others miss and pushes for thorough investigation over quick solutions.

Public Role: Field Commander, contract assignment, combat readiness

Secret: Brenna has a sealed letter from an Uthodurn contact warning of "arcane disturbances" across the frontier. This is campaign-wide foreshadowing.

• Wolves of Welton: Will push party to investigate thoroughly, suspects magical influence
• Frozen Sick: Recognizes blue-vein plague as unnatural
• Wild Sheep Chase: Remembers Shinebright from decades ago; deeply suspicious of magical mishaps involving him</description><ability name="Strength">15</ability><ability name="Dexterity">16</ability><ability name="Constitution">14</ability><ability name="Intelligence">13</ability><ability name="Wisdom">15</ability><ability name="Charisma">12</ability><skill name="Perception">5</skill><skill name="Survival">5</skill><skill name="Investigation">4</skill>

He believes they are connected to a single source: an ancient arcane engine buried beneath Northreach.

Public Role: Investigation support, magical research, threat analysis, lore

Secret: Elric has prophetic dreams he refuses to discuss. They always involve a tower of ice cracking open and something ancient awakening.

<note><name>Campaign Overview</name><text><![CDATA[NORTHWATCH WARDENS: SEASON ONE

A modular, drop-in guild campaign for 2–5 players designed for variable attendance and flexible scheduling.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CORE CONCEPT: THE AEORIAN ECHO

All adventures connect to a single spreading phenomenon: arcane magic from buried Aeorian ruins (Salsvault, far north) is destabilizing the frontier. No single adventure reveals the full picture; each provides clues that build toward the overarching mystery.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INCLUDED ADVENTURES:

1. OPENING ENCOUNTERS
   • Wolves at the Waystone Inn (party formation, level 1)
   • The Morning After (ceremony and first contract, level 1)

2. WOLVES OF WELTON (Levels 1–3)
   • Investigation with moral choice points
   • Three resolution paths: combat, negotiation, deception
   • Council voting mechanics
   • Contract W-17 (800 gp reward)

3. FROZEN SICK (Levels 2–4)
   • Survival adventure in northern plague town
   • Exploration of Aeorian ruins (Salsvault)
   • Direct revelation of Echo source

4. TEMPLE OF THE DRAGONKNIGHTS (Levels 4–5)
   • Capstone adventure with cult and dragon
   • Factions exploiting rising magic
   • Regional power consequences

5. THE WILD SHEEP CHASE (Levels 1–2)
   • Comedy one-shot with real stakes
   • Magic destabilizing everywhere (artifacts failing)
   • Excellent palate-cleanser between serious arcs

6. PERIL IN PINEBROOK (Levels 1–3)
   • Side trek showing frontier fragility
   • Every settlement vulnerable to Echo effects
   • Community-focused mystery

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY LOCATIONS:

• WAYSTONE INN (northwest) — Guild HQ, mission hub, sanctuary
• WELTON (west) — Agricultural village, first contract site
• PINEBROOK (southeast) — Trading village, side trek
• PALEBANK VILLAGE (north coast) — Seaside settlement, plague epicenter
• CROAKER CAVE (north of Palebank) — Bandit hideout, passage to ruins
• SALSVAULT (far north) — Buried Aeorian ruins, source of Echo
• TEMPLE OF THE DRAGONKNIGHTS (northwest mountains) — Cult stronghold
• NOKE'S TOWER (west of Waystone) — Wizard's tower, Sheep Chase location

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE:

Players are sworn Northwatch Wardens, members of a frontier guild operating from Waystone Inn. Each session:

1. Party gathers at guild HQ
2. Views contracts on the board
3. Accepts a mission
4. Completes adventure and returns
5. Receives payment and mysterious clues]]></text></note>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Opening Combat</name><text><![CDATA[OPENING COMBAT: Character Introduction Through Shared Threat

SETTING:
Dusk. Snow-flecked wind. Lanterns flickering outside the Waystone Inn. The party (strangers to one another) approaches the inn seeking shelter.

GOAL:
Introduce characters naturally through immediate combat threat. Unite the party through shared danger before formal introductions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COLD OPEN (Read Aloud):

"The wind bites as you trudge up the muddy road toward the Waystone Inn. Lantern-light spills across the snow, promising warmth and food. Then you hear it: a low, rumbling growl.

Two wolves slink out from behind the woodpile, ribs showing, eyes wild. Their hackles rise as they fix on you... and charge."

This immediately:
• Unites the characters through shared threat
• Creates urgency and momentum
• Avoids awkward "you meet in a tavern" exposition
• Establishes tone: frontier is dangerous

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ENCOUNTER: TWO DESPERATE WOLVES

**Wolves (2)**: CR 1/4 each, starving and desperate

**Terrain Features**:
• Woodpile: Half-cover (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
• Horse trough: Difficult terrain (frozen water, slippery)
• Lantern post: Can be knocked over (DC 12 DEX check) to create dim light/darkness
• Inn door: Slightly ajar; NPCs peek out but won't intervene until combat ends

**Starting Positions**:
• Wolves begin 20 ft from closest PC
• PCs are 10-15 ft apart from each other (arriving separately)
• Wolves target closest moving creature

This spacing forces characters to notice each other and converge naturally.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NATURAL CHARACTER INTRODUCTION

**Round 1: Recognition**

As initiative is rolled, give each PC a 1-sentence visual cue of the others:
• "You notice a cloaked figure to your left reaching for a weapon."
• "A heavily armored stranger steps between you and one of the wolves."
• "Someone behind you mutters a spell under their breath."

Creates instant awareness without forcing dialogue.

**Round 2: Forced Cooperation**

Have one wolf use Pack Tactics to flank a PC. This encourages intervention from another PC.

Example narration: "The wolf circles behind you, teeth bared. You realize the only person close enough to help is the stranger on your right."

This is the moment the party forms.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WOLF BEHAVIOR (Simple AI):

These wolves are:
• Hungry and desperate
• Not suicidal predators
• Testing for easy prey

**Behavior Script**:
• Attack nearest target
• If reduced to 4 HP or less, attempt to flee
• If both wolves drop below half HP, retreat together

This gives players sense of agency and realism—not every fight is to the death.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AFTERMATH: First Real Interaction

Once wolves flee or fall, give beat of silence:

"The wind settles. The wolves lie still in the snow. For the first time, you all really look at one another."

Then offer three natural prompts for introductions:

1. **Innkeeper Intervention**: Innkeeper bursts out: "By the gods! Are you all right? Come inside, quickly!" Forces group to enter together.

2. **Shared Clue**: One wolf has strange frost-rimmed patch of fur (hint toward Frozen Sick adventure). Gives them something to discuss.

3. **Practical Need**: Someone is injured and needs help. Encourages cooperation and reveals character personalities.

Pick whichever fits your table's tone.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPTIONAL: Quick Hooks to Bond Party

Use one or more:
• Innkeeper recognizes one PC and assumes others are their companions
• Dropped item (letter, map, charm) falls from wolf's mouth
• Witness says: "You three handled yourselves well. Are you mercenaries?"
• Shared room discount if they bunk together
• Marshal Brenna Thorne witnessed fight from window, impressed

All create cohesion without forcing roleplay.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TRANSITION TO MORNING AFTER:

After combat:
• Party enters inn together
• Shares meal and drinks (opportunity for character introductions)
• Rests for the night (long rest)
• Wakes the next morning to formal guild ceremony (uid 2013)

Brenna's opening line at ceremony references the fight: "Last night you proved yourselves. Today you become Northwatch Wardens."

This creates narrative continuity and makes the oath ceremony feel earned rather than arbitrary.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The wind bites as the three of you—strangers to one another—trudge up the muddy road toward the Waystone Inn. Lantern-light spills across the snow, promising warmth and food.

Then you hear it: a low, rumbling growl.

Two wolves slink out from behind the woodpile, ribs showing, eyes wild. Their hackles rise as they fix on you… and charge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Outside Waystone Inn, dusk

**SITUATION**: Party members (strangers to each other) arrive at Waystone Inn seeking shelter. Two starving wolves emerge from behind woodpile and attack.

**PURPOSE**: 
• First combat encounter of campaign
• Natural character introduction through shared danger
• Establishes frontier tone—unites characters through urgency
• Earns tomorrow's oath ceremony
• Avoids awkward "you meet in a tavern" trope

**STARTING POSITIONS**:
• 2 Wolves start 20 feet from nearest PC
• PCs are 10-15 feet apart (arriving from different directions)
• Woodpile behind wolves, horse trough nearby, lantern post illuminating area
• This spacing forces characters to notice each other and converge

**TERRAIN FEATURES**:
• **Woodpile**: Provides half cover (+2 AC/DEX saves)
• **Horse Trough**: Difficult terrain (frozen, slippery)
• **Lantern Post**: Can be knocked over (DC 12 DEX check) to create dim light or darkness
• **Inn Door**: Slightly ajar; NPCs peek out but won't intervene

**WOLF TACTICS**:
• These wolves are hungry, desperate, but not suicidal
• Attack nearest moving target
• Use Pack Tactics to flank when possible
• Flee if reduced to 4 HP or less
• Both retreat together if both below half HP
• Target closest moving creature—forces PC convergence

**CHARACTER INTRODUCTION** (Natural Party Formation):

**Round 1: Recognition**
As initiative is rolled, give each PC a 1-sentence visual cue of the others:
• "You notice a cloaked figure to your left reaching for a weapon."
• "A heavily armored stranger steps between you and one of the wolves."
• "Someone behind you mutters a spell under their breath."

This creates instant awareness without forcing dialogue.

**Round 2: Forced Cooperation**
Have one wolf use Pack Tactics to flank a PC. This encourages another PC to intervene.

Example narration: "The wolf circles behind you, teeth bared. You realize the only person close enough to help is the stranger on your right."

This is the moment the party forms.

**AFTERMATH** (The First Real Interaction):

Once the wolves flee or fall, give a beat of silence:

READ ALOUD:
The wind settles. The wolves lie still in the snow.
For the first time, you all really look at one another.

**Choose 1-2 natural prompts for introductions**:

1. **Innkeeper Bursts Out**: "By the gods! Are you all right? Come inside, quickly!" → Forces group entry together

<note><name>Ceremony Overview</name><text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Opening Scene):

As dawn breaks over Northreach, the Waystone Inn is already alive with the smell of hearthfire and fresh bread. Snowmelt drips from the eaves. The common room is quieter than last night—more purposeful, more expectant.

Marshal Brenna Thorne stands near the long table where the guild charter has been laid out, parchment weighted by a carved stone bearing the Northwatch crest. She nods as each of you approaches.

"Wardens aren't made by oaths alone," she says. "But this is where the work begins."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MORNING SCENE: Guild Charter Signing and Contract Assignment

SETTING:
The common room of Waystone Inn. Morning light streams through windows. Guild leadership gathers as new Wardens prepare for formal swearing-in.

CEREMONY SEQUENCE:

1. ARRIVAL
Party is invited to the common room. Other Wardens may be present. Innkeeper provides breakfast. Casual conversation establishes camaraderie.

<note><name>Adventure Overview</name><text><![CDATA[CONTRACT W-17: INVESTIGATION AND THREE RESOLUTION PATHS

OVERVIEW:
Investigation adventure set in agricultural village of Welton. Wolves are acting strangely—not just hunting livestock, but showing signs of intelligence and coordination. Party must investigate, make moral choices, and deal with village politics.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SITUATION:

Livestock losses have accelerated over two weeks. Initially thought to be normal wolf predation, but incidents show unnatural patterns:
• Wolves broke through reinforced fence (looks cut, not torn)
• Livestock driven into specific areas, not scattered
• Tracks suggest pack moving with deliberate strategy
• One shepherd swears he heard wolves speaking

Westly (village leader): Wants wolves eliminated, fears for safety.
Council members: Divided—some want combat, others suspicious of wolves' behavior.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTIGATION PHASE:

Party arrives in Welton. Westly briefs them:
"The attacks started two weeks ago. We've lost fifty sheep, two goats, and a horse. But something's wrong—they're not just eating. They're organizing."

Investigation steps:
1. Interview shepherds and witnesses
2. Examine attack sites and wolf tracks
3. Follow tracks into woods
4. Discover wolf den and observe wolves
5. First contact with Bolt (awakened alpha)

KEY DISCOVERIES:

• Wolves are intelligent and can speak simple words
• Two alpha wolves lead the pack: Bolt (strategic, cautious) and Flame (aggressive, territorial)
• Pack became intelligent after being exposed to magical energy (later revealed: Aeorian Echo from Alexi Merriksonn's death)
• Wolves don't want to destroy Welton—they want territory and respect
• Flame is pushing for expansion; Bolt is trying to negotiate

COUNCIL MEMBERS (For later voting):
1. Tillus Merrion (council leader) — pragmatist, needs convincing
2. Father Johan Merriksonn — priest, brother of Alexi; knows wolves became intelligent; will advocate for mercy
3. Corel — shepherd, Greywinter Hunts survivor; understands wolves; will vote for negotiation
4. Leanor Slatebeard — dwarf hunter; can be swayed by tactical argument
5. Meera — innkeeper; pragmatist, needs business incentive
6. Willen Featherock — trauma survivor; needs reassurance
7. Elder council member — conservative, hardest to sway

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PATH A: COMBAT ELIMINATION

If party refuses negotiation or fights wolves to death:

• Party defeats wolves in den combat (multiple encounters)
• Flame fights to death; Bolt may attempt escape
• Village celebrates; Westly is relieved
• Consequences:
  - Willen recovers slowly, remains traumatized
  - Merriksonn is sad but understanding
  - Corel is devastated (will know intelligence was real)
  - Party gains 800 gp reward
  - May introduce ghost of Alexi or vengeful spirits later

ENCOUNTERS:
• Perimeter wolves (scouts)
• Interior chamber with Flame, Bolt, and pack
• Wolf pups (moral choice: kill or spare)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PATH B: NEGOTIATION AND COEXISTENCE

If party approaches Bolt peacefully and wins council vote:

• Initial meeting with Bolt: "Pack became intelligent from Alexi's death. We do not wish to fight. Territory large. Could keep separate. Or we leave. But need time."
• Flame opposes: betrayal scene where Flame attacks Bolt from behind
• Party defeats Flame (with or without killing)
• Bolt's leadership solidified
• Council voting:
  - Automatic YES: Merriksonn, Corel
  - Persuadable (need 1+ more): Tillus (DC 15 Persuasion), Leanor (tactical argument), Meera (business incentive), Willen (reassurance), Elder (hardest)
  - Majority (3+) passes coexistence agreement

CONSEQUENCES:
• Wolves retreat to deeper territory or respect boundaries
• Willen recovers faster, becomes advocate for peace
• Merriksonn satisfied, becomes ally
• Corel becomes valuable NPC ally
• Party gains reputation: "negotiator/peacekeeper"
• Other regions hear of success; possible future negotiations with other intelligent creatures

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PATH C: DECEPTION

If party claims wolves eliminated but they actually survived:

• Party must succeed DC 15 Deception vs. Father Merriksonn's +5 Insight
• If success: Village believes story, party gets 800 gp, wolves remain in territory
• If failure: Merriksonn sees through it, undermines party reputation
• If discovered later: Wolves' return creates crisis; party must handle actual resolution
• Long-term complications but short-term success

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SCALING FOR PARTY SIZE:

2 players: Fewer wolves, 1 alpha instead of 2
3 players: Standard encounters as written
4–5 players: Add 2–3 extra wolves, reinforce Flame's allies

REWARDS:
• Base: 800 gp
• Path B (negotiation): +political favor from Merriksonn and Corel
• All paths: Lore clue about "awakening magic from the north"]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Around 150 feet ahead of you, the road bends between an outcrop of rocks and the borders of a mossy woodland. Two weathered shepherds drive a small flock of sheep through the gap, four sheepdogs trotting alongside them.

Suddenly, the dogs prick up their ears and start frantically barking. The shepherds immediately pull long wooden clubs from their belts, looking about in clear distress.

In the blink of an eye, lean grey shapes burst out from both sides of the road—all launching themselves at the sheep with incredible speed.

Eight wolves. Moving with unnatural coordination.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Road to Welton, 150ft from bend between rocky outcrop and woodland edge

**SITUATION**: Party approaches Welton when they witness organized wolf ambush on shepherds. This is their first indication that something unusual is happening with the wolves.

**PURPOSE**:
• Introduction to Wolves of Welton threat
• Establishes wolves' unusual coordination and intelligence
• Creates immediate sympathy for Welton's plight
• Optional combat before reaching village

**STARTING POSITIONS**: 
• Party begins 150ft from the action
• Shepherds and dogs are in the middle of the ambush zone
• Wolves attacking from both sides of road
• Assuming party intervenes, roll initiative with party starting at 150ft distance

**WOLF TACTICS**:
• **Primary objective**: Steal sheep, NOT kill shepherds
• Half distract shepherds and dogs (bite arms/legs, avoid killing blows)
• Half grab sheep and retreat westward into woods
• Test party strength for 1-2 rounds of combat
• Retreat quickly if clearly outmatched
• Wolves are here to steal, not die
• If party tries to communicate, wolves may respond with a few confused words before fleeing

**INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR**:
Wolves coordinate with unusual precision. They use flanking tactics, cover each other's retreats, and seem to follow unspoken commands. Observant characters (DC 12 Wisdom (Insight)) notice the wolves are too organized for normal beasts.

**AFTERMATH**:
Injured shepherds grateful for help (if provided). They offer to guide party to Welton and share "Shaggy Wolf Stories" gossip:
• Sorcerer Alexi Merriksonn disappeared when attacks began
• Wolves opened locked barns somehow
• Merchant chased off cart—horses and leather stolen
• Shepherd heard voices calling for help (distraction tactic)
• Village posse ambushed in woods with fire and thunder
• Halfling named Featherock badly injured, claims wolves talked

**COMBAT NOTES**:
• 8 Wolves (MM p341): AC 13, HP 11 (2d8+2), Speed 40 ft., Bite +4 (2d4+2 piercing), Pack Tactics, Keen Hearing/Smell
• Shepherds: 2 Commoners with clubs, will not pursue into woods
• Sheepdogs: 4 Mastiffs, loyal but won't chase into forest

**XP REWARD**: 200 XP per wolf defeated (800 XP if half killed, 1600 XP if all killed—unlikely as they flee when losing)

**INVESTIGATION OPPORTUNITIES**:
• Tracks lead west into woods (Survival DC 14 to follow)
• Wolves carrying sheep easier to track (DC 11)
• Strips of colored cloth tied around some wolves' limbs/necks (unusual decoration)
• Scorch marks on ground where wolves emerged (evidence of magical awakening)

**ENCOUNTER VARIATIONS**:
• If party does nothing: Wolves kill 3 sheep, injure 1 shepherd, flee successfully
• If party charges immediately: Wolves grab 1 sheep, test party strength, retreat after 2 rounds
• If party uses ranged attacks: Wolves prioritize grabbing sheep and escaping over combat
• If party attempts to speak with wolves: Wolves freeze momentarily, exchange confused glances, one might growl "Hunters... run!" before fleeing

This encounter establishes the wolves' intelligence, organization, and reluctance to kill sentient beings unnecessarily.]]></text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

After two hours of travel through dense undergrowth, the sound of snapping twigs and rustling leaves grows louder ahead of you. Something big is making its way through the Western Woods.

The sound grows closer.

Suddenly, an enormous shape crashes through the bushes—an owlbear, its massive form a terrifying blend of bear and owl. But even at a glance, you can tell something is wrong. It's limping, ribs showing through matted fur, nursing barely-healed wounds clotted with old, black blood.

It sights you.

Despite its injuries, the beast lets out a deafening hoot and charges.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Western Woods, 2 hours from Welton, approximately halfway to wolf den

**SITUATION**: Wounded owlbear encounters party during journey to wolf lair

**PURPOSE**:
• Optional combat encounter (adds depth, not required for plot)
• Physical evidence of wolves' growing power
• Shows wolves drove off apex predator
• Introduces draconic magic element (scorch marks)
• Tests party resources before final confrontation

<text>**LOCATION**: Western Woods, approximately 2 hours into wilderness trek

**SITUATION**: Optional encounter adding combat depth. After party travels through dense undergrowth, sounds of snapping twigs and rustling leaves approach—something big is coming.

**ARRIVAL**: Unless party immediately hides (Dexterity (Stealth) vs. Owlbear's passive Perception 13), an **Owlbear** (MM p249) crashes through bushes and sights them.

**OWLBEAR CONDITION**:
• Visibly injured, limping, thin and malnourished
• Barely-healed wounds clotted with old black blood
• Current HP: 40 (reduced from normal 59 maximum)
• Still operates at full effectiveness despite injuries
• Starving and desperate—will not retreat

**COMBAT**:
Owlbear charges the easiest target immediately, letting out deafening hoot. Fights until killed—no morale checks, no surrender.

**OWLBEAR STATS** (Modified):
• AC 13 (natural armor)
• HP 40/40 (max reduced from 59 due to injuries)
• Speed 40 ft.
• STR 20 (+5), DEX 12 (+1), CON 17 (+3), INT 3 (-4), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 7 (-2)
• Skills: Perception +3
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13
• Challenge: 3 (700 XP, but easier due to reduced HP)
• **Keen Sight and Smell**: Advantage on Perception checks using sight or smell
• **Multiattack**: Two attacks—one Beak, one Claws. If both hit same target, extra 2d8 damage (Hug).
  - **Beak**: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d10+5 piercing
  - **Claws**: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d8+5 slashing

**POST-COMBAT INVESTIGATION**:
After killing Owlbear, party can examine wounds:

**Automatic Observations**:
• Injuries caused by sharp jaws (bite marks)
• Wounds appear 2-3 weeks old
• Scorch marks on fur (fire damage)

**Wisdom (Nature) DC 12**:
• Bite patterns confirm wolf pack attack
• Very rare for wolves to challenge Owlbears—normally avoid each other
• If encounter occurs during day: Owlbears are nocturnal, shouldn't be active in sunlight (suggests desperation or forced from den)

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
• Owlbear prioritizes closest/weakest-looking target
• Uses Multiattack every turn
• Hug ability triggers automatically when both attacks hit same creature
• Ignores opportunity attacks if fleeing target moves away (but will not flee)
• If party tries to calm or negotiate: Animal Intelligence 3 means no communication possible—attacks regardless

**XP REWARD**: 700 XP (split among party)

**STORY IMPLICATIONS**:
This encounter reveals the wolves' growing dominance in the region. They drove off a powerful predator that had plagued the woods for years, demonstrating both their enhanced intelligence and magical abilities (scorch marks = Flame's fire breath).

**OPTIONAL DEVELOPMENT**:
If party camps nearby after battle, they might hear distant wolf howls that sound almost like... words? (Foreshadowing wolves' speech abilities)

**LOOT**: 
• Owlbear beak and claws (25 gp value to right buyer)
• Alchemical components from glands (50 gp if harvested with Survival DC 15)

**SCALING**:
• 2 players: Owlbear HP reduced to 30
• 4-5 players: Owlbear at full 59 HP despite injuries
• Adjust based on party resources—if low on HP/spells, reduce Owlbear HP further or allow escape after dealing 25+ damage]]></text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Welton sits on the banks of a slow-moving river, gentle hills rising on each side. The houses and shops are built of oak painted bright white, many with elaborate carvings worked into the eaves. Wheat fields stretch into the distance, and sheep graze on nearby hillsides.

This should be a prosperous farming village. But something is wrong.

Too many people idle in the muddy streets, openly worried. The dirt roads have been churned to quagmires by unusually heavy traffic. You notice families camped in the village square—refugees from outlying farms.

Ahead stands the Shepherd's Crook, an ancient inn sitting opposite two large guild halls. Even from here, you can hear raised voices inside.

<note><name>Scene Details: Welton Village</name><text><![CDATA[**LOCATION**: Welton village—farming community on slow-moving river

**ATMOSPHERE**:
• White-painted oak buildings with elaborate eaves
• Gentle hills rise on both sides of valley
• Wheat fields and sheep pastures visible
• Muddy streets from heavy traffic
• Unusually high number of idlers—displaced shepherds and farmers

**VILLAGE DESCRIPTION**:
Welton sits on banks of slow-moving river. Houses and shops are oak, painted bright white, with elaborate carvings worked into eaves. Wheat and sheep farming dominate local economy. People pay more attention to weather and wool prices than distant wars.

Population mostly human, with sizable halfling minority and handful of dwarves. Village isn't poverty-stricken, but crisis evident:
• More people idling in streets than normal for harvest season
• Many appear concerned, hungry, worried about food
• Heavy traffic has reduced dirt streets to muddy quagmires

**KEY LOCATIONS**:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE SHEPHERD'S CROOK INN**:
Ancient inn, one of oldest/largest buildings. Opposite Growers' Hall and Fleecers' Hall. Traditional layout: common room front, private dining/meeting room back, guest rooms upstairs.

**Atmosphere**: Always crowded now. Tanned shepherds in woolen cloaks smoke long-stemmed pipes, drinking cider, muttering. Small groups of young men/women nurse drinks, stay quiet.

**Innkeeper**: **Leanor Slatebeard** (female dwarf, AC 10, HP 15, commoner stats)
• Runs bar while husband Banteth handles kitchen/brewing
• Excited if party mentions they're adventurers
• Offers free round of drinks + meal once they talk to village council
• People in inn impressed, though old shepherds remain dour/cynical

**Leanor's Information**:
• "The wolves opened the gate at Westly's farm—opened it! Like they had hands!"
• "Featherock's upstairs, poor soul. Be gentle with him if you speak to him."
• "Council's meeting in the back room. They're desperate for help."
• DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) for additional rumors about Alexi Merriksonn

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE COUNCIL MEETING**:
Plain room, centered around large wooden table with 8 chairs. Currently occupied:
• 5 human men
• 1 human woman  
• 2 halflings (1 male, 1 female)

**As Party Approaches**: Raised voices audible. When they enter, **Tillus Merrion** (male halfling) bitterly arguing with **Father Merriksonn** (human priest) about whether village should stop exporting grain while wolf crisis unresolved.

**Key Council Members**:

**Tillus Merrion** (Growers and Buyers' Association):
• Male halfling, late 40s, AC 10, HP 15
• Reacts angrily to interruption
• Quickly warms if party identifies as adventurers
• Pushes hard for immediate action—wolves are bankrupting farmers

**Father Merriksonn** (Village Priest):
• Male human, mid-50s, AC 10, HP 20
• Calm, measured, concerned for safety
• Mentions brother **Alexi** (sorcerer) went missing when attacks began
• Forced village to seek professional adventurers
• Can discuss werewolf possibility (DC 10 Intelligence to ask)
  - "Several full moons since attacks began, not one person shows curse signs. Still, I'm no expert on such dark matters."

**Corel** (Fleecers' Guild):
• Male human, late 50s, tuft of wool tied to vest
• Works hills for 40 years—knows terrain intimately
• Happy to answer questions on local environment
• Offers general support and guidance

**Council's Offer** (if party hasn't accepted contract):
• 800 gp reward
• Free lodging at Shepherd's Crook
• Small favors and future trading opportunities

**Council's Information**:
1. **Attack Pattern**: Wolves driving people from farms/outlying hamlets. Taking entire herds—sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens.
2. **Unusual Behavior**: Opening gates, pulling down fences, ambushing shepherds during moves
3. **Timeline**: Three months ago wolves went from nuisance to major threat
4. **Economic Impact**: People abandoning farms. Village must either stop exporting (bankruptcy) or go hungry
5. **Failed Posse**: Council organized hunting party—attacked in woods, driven back with losses
6. **Alexi's Disappearance**: Sorcerer vanished same time attacks began (~3 months ago)
7. **Suspected Lair**: Wolves believed to live in woods west of town (not confirmed)

**Social Challenge**:
DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) to convince council party is capable
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) to ask right questions about attack patterns
DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) to sense Tillus is hiding financial desperation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FEATHEROCK'S ROOM** (Upstairs at Shepherd's Crook):
Small but well-appointed room. Fresh flowers on dresser.

**Willen Featherock** lies in bed:
• Male halfling, late 30s
• White-faced, soaked in sweat
• Left arm bandaged, right leg bandaged
• AC 10, HP 8/15 (wounded), commoner stats
• Regularly attended by Father Merriksonn

**Initial Reaction**: Shies away from party. Will talk if they promise to believe him.

**Featherock's Account**:
"When the posse was attacked, I was bitten badly. Trampled as the others fled. I remember... gruff voices arguing in the darkness. A powerful grip on my ankle, dragging me."

**DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion)** to get him to continue:
"The wolves were *talking*. Arguing fiercely over whether they should eat me or not. I heard words—actual words! One said 'Leave him,' another said 'Too dangerous, he heard us.' Then everything went black."

**Aftermath**: Featherock breaks down in tears. Refuses to say more. Party can offer comfort (DC 10 Wisdom check for advantage on future Featherock interactions).

**Featherock's Wounds**:
DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine): Bite marks consistent with dire wolf or larger predator. Wounds partially cauterized—unusual for animal attack. Suggests magical heat source nearby during injury.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**VILLAGE GENERAL STORE**:
Small shop with basic supplies. Proprietor **Marta Henwick** (female human, nervous, AC 10, HP 12).

**Available Supplies**:
• Rope (50 ft.): 1 gp
• Torches (10): 1 sp
• Rations (10 days): 5 sp
• Basic healing supplies: poultice (1d4 HP recovery, 5 gp)
• Shepherd's crook (improvised weapon, 5 sp)

**Marta's Rumors** (DC 10 Charisma):
• "Westly found his barn *locked from the inside* after wolves took his sheep!"
• "Some say Alexi went into the woods and never came back. Others say he became one of them."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**OTHER VILLAGE LOCATIONS**:

**Growers' Hall**: Administrative building for farming guild. Mostly empty now—people in fields or displaced.

**Fleecers' Hall**: Wool processing and trade center. Activity reduced to quarter of normal volume.

**Village Square**: Muddy, churned by heavy foot/hoof traffic. Makeshift refugee camp for displaced families.

**Merriksonn's Chapel**: Small shrine to Erathis (god of civilization/community). Father Merriksonn spends nights here in prayer.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════]]></text></note>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Scene 2</name><text><![CDATA[**PACING**: This is primarily a social/investigation scene. No combat expected unless party causes trouble.

**OBJECTIVE**: Gather information, build relationships with NPCs, understand scope of wolf problem.

**KEY INFORMATION TO CONVEY**:
1. Wolves are unusually intelligent (opening gates, speaking)
2. Alexi Merriksonn disappeared 3 months ago (same time as attacks)
3. Wolves are in woods to the west
4. Economic desperation is real—village on brink of collapse
5. Featherock heard wolves *talking*

**ESTIMATED TIME**: 30-45 minutes

**SKILL CHECK OPPORTUNITIES**:
• Persuasion: Getting NPCs to open up
• Insight: Reading between the lines of council politics
• Investigation: Noticing patterns in attack descriptions
• Medicine: Examining Featherock's wounds

**TRANSITION TO SCENE 3**:
When party has gathered enough information, Corel offers to help them plan their approach to the wolves' lair. If party wants to head out immediately, Leanor offers supplies and warns them not to underestimate the wolves.

**NPC MOTIVATIONS**:
• Tillus: Desperate to resolve crisis before complete economic ruin
• Merriksonn: Wants to protect villagers; secretly hopes to find brother alive
• Corel: Practical, experienced; wants effective solution, not heroic deaths
• Leanor: Protective of village; sees adventurers as last hope
• Featherock: Traumatized; wants validation that he's not crazy

**OPTIONAL EXPANSION**:
If party wants to investigate Alexi's disappearance further, they can:
• Visit his cottage (abandoned, signs of hasty departure)
• Talk to villagers who knew him (DC 12 Investigation for clues about his destination)
• Examine his study (DC 15 Arcana reveals research into awakening animals)]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Scene 3: Plan of Attack</name><uid>2184</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The council meeting has ended. The village needs answers, and the only way to get them is to find the wolves' lair.

Corel, the weathered shepherd, steps forward.

"The lair's in the woods to the west," he says, voice quiet but firm. "Dense undergrowth, thick with moss and shadows. You'll smell earth and rot before you see anything. Journey takes maybe four hours at walking pace. The wolves... they'll know you're coming. Question is, how do you want them to find out?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**OBJECTIVE**: Find the wolves' lair in the Western Woods

**LOCATION**: Wolf lair is in hollow just beyond woods covering hillsides west of Welton

**PLANNING PHASE** (in Welton):

**Corel's Suggestions** (if party seeks guidance):
1. **Direct Tracking**: If party has strong Survival skill, head to western woods and pick up trail
2. **Bait Strategy**: If interested in luring wolves out, Corel reluctantly offers his own flock as bait

**Corel as Guide** (if party lacks tracker):
• Corel reluctantly volunteers his services
• AC 10, HP 15, Commoner stats
• Wisdom 14, Survival +4
• Practical, knows terrain intimately
• Won't take unnecessary risks

**Bait Strategy** (if party chooses):
• Set up trap using Corel's flock in visible pasture
• 6 **Wolves** attack using same tactics as Scene 1
• Wolves use hit-and-run: grab sheep, flee west
• If party tries to talk, wolves respond with few words before fleeing in confusion:
  - "Leave us alone!"
  - "We need to survive!"
  - "The Giver promised us safety!"

**Combat Stats for Bait Ambush** (if triggered):
6 Wolves (MM p341)
• AC 13, HP 11 each
• Speed 40 ft.
• Bite: +4 to hit, 2d4+2 piercing, DC 11 STR save or prone
• Pack Tactics: Advantage on attacks if ally within 5 ft.
• Keen Hearing/Smell: Advantage on Perception using hearing/smell

**Tactics**: Coordinated strikes, grab sheep, retreat west. If 2+ wolves drop, remainder flee.

**XP**: 200 XP total (50 XP per wolf × 4 wolves, assuming 2 escape)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**JOURNEY THROUGH THE WESTERN WOODS**:

**Atmosphere**: Thick woods clogged with undergrowth. Smell of earth and moss fills air. Constant rustle of small animals in bushes. Occasional howl of lone wolf echoes eerily from west.

**Travel Time**: Approximately 4 hours at walking pace

**Skill Check Guidelines**:

**Tracking Wolf Through Woods**:
• DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) for recent tracks (< 8 hours old)
• DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) for older tracks (8+ hours old)
• Advantage if tracking wolf carrying prey (leave deeper prints, drag marks)
• Fresh tracks: DC 11 (prey) / DC 14 (no prey)

**Hiding from Wolves**:
• Dexterity (Stealth) opposed by Wolf's Wisdom (Perception) +3
• Wolves have advantage on Perception checks using scent/sound
• Downwind: Party has advantage on Stealth
• Upwind: Wolves have additional advantage (effectively +10 to passive)

**Understanding Wolf Habits**:
• DC 12 Wisdom (Nature): Recognize territorial markers, den location patterns
• DC 15 Intelligence (Nature): Understand unusual organization suggests magical influence
• DC 18 Arcana: Detect faint transmutation magic residue on older tracks

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RANDOM ENCOUNTERS** (Optional, roll 1d6 every hour):

**1-4: No Encounter**
Peaceful travel. Party can make additional Survival checks to track or scout ahead.

**5: Wolf Scouts**
2 **Wolves** observe party from distance:
• DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) to notice watchers
• If spotted, wolves howl warning and flee toward den
• If unspotted, wolves shadow party for 1 hour then report back
• **CONSEQUENCE**: If wolves escape, den defenders gain +2 to initiative in Scene 5

**6: Tracking Clues**
Party discovers significant evidence:
• Roll 1d4 for clue type:
  1. **Sheep Pen Remains**: Crude fence made from stolen wood, broken open. Fresh tracks lead west. Automatic success on next tracking check.
  2. **Abandoned Camp**: Circular clearing with charred fire pit. Bones (sheep) arranged in neat pile. DC 10 Investigation reveals ash contains traces of blue flame (draconic magic).
  3. **Territorial Marker**: Tree trunk heavily scratched at 6-foot height. DC 12 Nature reveals claw marks too high for normal wolves. Something larger marked this territory.
  4. **Alexi's Journal Page**: Torn parchment caught on bramble. Partial entry: "...the Awakening ritual succeeded beyond expectations. They understand me now. Tomorrow I will give them the gift of...". Rest torn away.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**:

**Dense Undergrowth**:
• Speed reduced to half unless party succeeds DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
• Failure: Speed remains halved, disadvantage on Stealth checks (loud crashing)
• Success: Move at normal speed, maintain stealth

**Creek Crossing**:
• 15-foot-wide creek, knee-deep, fast-flowing
• DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) to cross safely
• Failure: Fall into water, swept 10 feet downstream, soaked (disadvantage on Stealth for 1 hour)
• Success: Cross safely

**Steep Hillside**:
• Final approach to wolf lair requires climbing 30-foot incline
• DC 11 Strength (Athletics) to climb without issue
• Failure: Slip, make noise (alerts wolves in den if within 100 feet)
• Success: Reach ridge overlooking hollow with wolf den

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**APPROACHING THE DEN**:

As party nears wolf lair (last 500 feet), increased signs:
• Fresh tracks everywhere—dozens of wolves
• Stripped sheep carcasses hanging from trees (organized, deliberate placement)
• Worn paths through undergrowth leading toward single point
• Smell of woodsmoke and cooked meat

**Scouting the Final Approach**:
• DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) to spot den entrance from treeline without being seen
• DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) to approach within 50 feet undetected
• Failure on Stealth: Triggers tripwire alarm at treeline (see Scene 5)

**What Party Can Observe** (from treeline):
• Cave entrance 10 ft. wide × 10 ft. tall, set into low cliff of grey stone
• Thin smoke plume rising from hill ~30 ft. back from entrance (chimney hole)
• 6 Wolves milling around: some by fire, some working on fence, some tearing sheep carcass
• Many wolves wear strips of brightly-colored cloth or decorations on limbs/necks
• Scene remarkably peaceful and organized for wolf den

**Alternate Entrance Discovery**:
• DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice chimney hole on hilltop
• Chimney just large enough for Small creature to squeeze through
• Opens into eastern sub-chamber, 15 feet above fire
• If party listens from above (DC 10 Perception): Hear **Flame** and **Bolt** arguing:
  - Flame: "Kill more humans! Speed up their retreat!"
  - Bolt (soft tones): "No—few more raids, then disappear into wilderness."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Scene 3</name><text><![CDATA[**PACING**: Exploration and travel scene. Balance between challenge and progress.

**OBJECTIVE**: Build tension as party approaches wolf lair. Allow creative problem-solving.

**KEY DECISIONS FOR PARTY**:
1. Track wolves directly or use bait?
2. Approach stealthily or aggressively?
3. Use main entrance or find alternate route?

**ESTIMATED TIME**: 45-60 minutes

**SKILL CHECK PHILOSOPHY**:
Don't let failed checks stop progress. Failed tracking = slower progress or unexpected encounter, not "you're lost forever."

**COREL'S ROLE** (if accompanying):
• Provides advantage on Survival checks in woods (knows terrain)
• Can point out landmarks and shortcuts
• Warns party about wolf behavior patterns
• Will NOT enter den—waits at treeline, guards escape route

**BAIT STRATEGY CONSEQUENCES**:
If party uses bait and wolves escape back to den:
• Den defenders are alerted and prepared
• Lose element of surprise
• Tripwire alarm automatically triggered when party approaches
• +2 initiative for wolves in Scene 5

**STEALTH VS. DIRECT APPROACH**:
Successful stealth allows party to:
• Scout den layout from treeline
• Discover alternate entrance (chimney hole)
• Overhear Flame and Bolt arguing
• Position themselves advantageously

Failed stealth or direct approach:
• Triggers tripwire alarm
• Wolves assume defensive positions
• No element of surprise

**RANDOM ENCOUNTER TIMING**:
Use random encounters to:
• Add tension during long travel
• Provide additional clues about Alexi
• Foreshadow draconic magic involvement
• Don't overuse—1-2 encounters maximum for 4-hour journey

**TRACKING CLUES SIGNIFICANCE**:
• **Sheep Pen Remains**: Shows wolves' organization
• **Abandoned Camp**: Reveals draconic magic connection (Flame's breath weapon)
• **Territorial Marker**: Hints at larger-than-normal wolves (Flame and Bolt are Large)
• **Alexi's Journal**: Confirms Alexi gave wolves intelligence via Awakening ritual

**TRANSITION TO SCENE 5**:
Scene ends when party:
• Reaches treeline overlooking den, OR
• Triggers tripwire alarm and enters combat, OR
• Attempts to enter den (main entrance or chimney hole)

Scene 5 begins immediately after party decides on approach method.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE TIPS**:
• Dense undergrowth: Reward creative solutions (Druid can use Plant Growth to clear path, etc.)
• Creek crossing: Allow rope/teamwork for automatic success
• Steep hillside: Failure creates noise, not injury—builds tension, not frustration

**NPC REACTIONS** (if Corel accompanies):
• Impressed by clever tracking/stealth
• Nervous as signs of wolves increase
• Refuses to enter den: "I'm no coward, but I know my limits. This is your task, not mine."
• Will defend party's escape route if needed]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching from Treeline):

From the treeline, you see a cave entrance—roughly 10 feet wide and tall—set into a low cliff of grey stone. A thin plume of smoke rises from somewhere above the cliff, maybe 30 feet back.

Milling around the entrance are six wolves. Some sit near what looks like a small fire. Others appear to be... working? Improving a crude fence? One tears at a sheep carcass.

Many wear strips of brightly-colored cloth tied around their limbs and necks.

The entire scene is remarkably organized. Peaceful, even.

Too organized for wolves.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (If Tripwire Triggered or Direct Approach):

Bone noisemakers clatter loudly.

The wolves' heads snap toward you. One lets out a high-pitched howl.

Another yells—actually YELLS—in guttural, growling Common:

"HUNTERS!"

The pack scatters into defensive positions. From inside the cave, you hear answering howls.

Two enormous wolves emerge from the den—larger than any you've seen before. One's eyes glow with orange flame, thin strips of red light crackling across its fur like magma beneath stone. The other pulses with blue lightning, its voice rumbling with thunder.

The larger, flame-eyed wolf snarls:

"Kill them! Protect the pack!"

The lightning wolf's voice is softer, but carries authority:

"Defend the pups! Do not let them reach the nursery!"

<text>**LOCATION**: Cave den on western edge of woods, set into low cliff of grey stone

**APPROACH**:
From treeline, party sees:
• Cave entrance 10ft wide × 10ft tall
• Thin smoke plume from point on hill ~30ft back from entrance (chimney hole)
• Six **Wolves** milling around: some by fire, some working on fence, some tearing sheep carcass
• Many wolves wear strips of brightly-colored cloth or decorations on limbs/necks
• Scene remarkably peaceful and organized for wolf den

**TRIPWIRE ALARM**: 
DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) to spot bone noisemakers at treeline edge. Failure triggers alert—all wolves howl and assume defensive positions.

**ALTERNATE ENTRANCE** (Chimney Hole):
• 30ft back from cave entrance on hilltop
• Just large enough for Small creature to squeeze through
• Opens into eastern sub-chamber, 15ft above fire
• If party listens: **Flame** and **Bolt** arguing about adventurers' arrival
  - Flame: "Kill more humans! Speed up their retreat!"
  - Bolt (soft tones): "No—few more raids, then disappear into wilderness."

**CAVE LAYOUT**:
• **Central Chamber**: Main living area, leaf/cloth beds, bone piles, charcoal wall art showing pack's history (DC 12 Perception reveals images of human giving gifts to wolves before disappearing—Alexi Merriksonn)
• **Western Sub-Chamber**: Storeroom with stolen sheep in crude fence, bags of leather/wool, mundane tools (knives, shovel)
• **Central Sub-Chamber**: Nursery with 6 wolf pups (use Cat stats MM p320), guarded by 2 wolves who fight to death to protect young
• **Eastern Sub-Chamber**: Meeting room with fire, smoke vents through ceiling hole

**INITIAL CONFRONTATION**:
If wolves become aware (tripwires, failed stealth, or party walks into hollow):
• Wolves panic, high-pitched howls
• One wolf yells "HUNTERS!" in guttural Common
• Unless party defuses immediately, wolves attack with fierce determination

**COMBAT DEPLOYMENT** (If Battle Begins):
**Round 1**: 6 Wolves outside attack
**Round 2**: **Flame** and **Bolt** emerge with 4 armored wolves (AC 14, +1 from crude leather)

**ALPHA PAIR STATS**:

**FLAME** (Alpha Female):
• Large Beast, Chaotic Neutral
• AC 14 (natural armor), HP 47 (7d10+10), Speed 50 ft.
• STR 17 (+3), DEX 15 (+2), CON 15 (+2), INT 12 (+1), WIS 14 (+2), CHA 8 (-1)
• Skills: Perception +3, Stealth +4
• Passive Perception 13
• Languages: Common (broken, growling speech)
• Challenge: 2 (450 XP)
• **Keen Hearing/Smell**: Advantage on Perception using hearing/smell
• **Pack Tactics**: Advantage on attacks if ally within 5 ft. of target
• **Bite**: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d6+3 piercing. DC 13 STR save or knocked prone.
• **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: 15-foot cone, DC 13 DEX save, 2d8 fire damage (half on success)

**BOLT** (Alpha Male):
• Large Beast, Lawful Neutral
• AC 14 (natural armor), HP 47 (7d10+10), Speed 50 ft.
• STR 17 (+3), DEX 15 (+2), CON 15 (+2), INT 12 (+1), WIS 14 (+2), CHA 8 (-1)
• Skills: Perception +3, Stealth +4
• Passive Perception 13
• Languages: Common (careful, deliberate speech)
• Challenge: 2 (450 XP)
• **Keen Hearing/Smell**: Advantage on Perception using hearing/smell
• **Pack Tactics**: Advantage on attacks if ally within 5 ft. of target
• **Bite**: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d6+3 piercing. DC 13 STR save or knocked prone.
• **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: 30-foot line, DC 13 DEX save, 2d8 lightning damage (half on success)

**COMBAT TACTICS**:
• Wolves use Pack Tactics extensively, flanking and surrounding
• Use speed (40-50 ft.) to outflank and target lightly-armored casters
• Flame leads front-line assault, uses Fire Breath liberally (doesn't care about friendly fire—may catch 1-2 wolves if it hits whole party)
• Bolt leads strategically, uses Lightning Breath carefully (never harms allies—positions line shots)
• Armored wolves (AC 14) protect Alpha Pair
• Standard wolves harry flanks and protect pups

**BOLT'S CALL FOR PARLEY**:
After ONE of these conditions:
• 4 wolves killed
• Flame OR Bolt reduced below 24 HP (half)
• Any PC dropped to 0 HP

Bolt roars thunderously: "ENOUGH! This helps NO ONE! We can TALK!"

**Party's Choice**:
• **Ignore**: Wolves fight to death (tragic ending)
• **Listen**: Negotiation opportunity (see below)

**NEGOTIATION PATH**:

Bolt explains:
• Pack attacked sorcerer Alexi Merriksonn trespassing on territory
• Flash of bright light—Alexi vanished, wolves awakened with intelligence
• "Lightbringer" gave them minds, speech, memories in dreams
• Pack used abilities to improve life: hoard sheep for pups' winter survival, care for elderly, drove off Owlbear
• Flame wants to punish/kill humans, claim land by right
• Bolt willing to negotiate: wolves control western woods/uninhabited lands, keep area predator-free, stop raiding
• Alternative: Pack moves to remote location if party swears not to reveal their intelligence

**FLAME'S BETRAYAL**:
If deal seems imminent, Flame accuses Bolt of cowardice and attacks him from behind (surprise attack, deals 2d6+3 damage, takes Bolt out of fight). All 4 armored wolves join her in final desperate attack. Other wolves fall back confused.

**After Flame's Defeat**:
• Bolt badly injured but alive
• Remaining wolves submit to Bolt's leadership
• Party can negotiate terms (immediate exodus, territorial boundaries, or coexistence pact)
• Pups spared if party merciful

**MORAL CHOICE** (If Party Finds Pups):
6 wolf pups guarded by 2 desperate adult wolves. Adults beg: "Please... let young ones go... never return... please..."
• Kill pups: Adult wolves fight to death screaming for pups to flee. Dark outcome.
• Spare pups: Adults gather pups and flee. Bolt deeply grateful if he's alive. Future ally possible.

**XP REWARDS**:
• 6 standard wolves: 1200 XP (200 each)
• 4 armored wolves: 1000 XP (250 each)
• Flame: 450 XP
• Bolt: 450 XP (only if killed—negotiation gives different reward)
• Total Combat: 3100 XP
• Negotiation Success: 1000 XP bonus for peaceful resolution

**LOOT**:
• Stolen goods in storeroom: 150 gp worth of leather, wool, tools
• Bright cloth decorations (wolf culture—worthless monetarily but historically significant)
• Evidence of Alexi's presence: scorched ground patterns matching Wild Magic surge

**OUTCOMES**:
• **All Wolves Dead**: Village celebrates, 800 gp reward, but Corel/Merriksonn saddened
• **Bolt Negotiates**: Village vote required (see Welton Council Clash encounter)
• **Deception** (claim all dead but spared some): DC 15 Deception vs. Merriksonn's +5 Insight</text>

<note><name>Adventure Overview</name><text><![CDATA[ADVENTURE: PALEBANK PLAGUE AND AEORIAN RUINS

OVERVIEW:
Survival adventure in northern plague town. Party must investigate disease origin, survive harsh environment, explore active Aeorian ruins (Salsvault), and decide how to handle the source of the Aeorian Echo itself.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SITUATION:

Palebank Village (northeastern coast) is gripped by mysterious plague:
• Blue veins spread across skin like ice cracks
• High fever, slow progression to death (3–7 days)
• Started 2 weeks ago; now 20+ infected
• Local healer suspects magical origin
• Rumors: Relics dug up from ice, things emerged from glacier

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTIGATION PHASE:

Party arrives in Palebank. Local healer (Verla Pelc) briefs them:
"It's not a natural sickness. The veins... they glow faintly in the dark. Whatever this is, it came from the north."

Investigation:
1. Interview sick residents
2. Find relic site where sickness began
3. Track back to source: Croaker Cave (bandit hideout)
4. Bandits looted Aeorian artifacts from glacier
5. Spores from artifacts are infectious

REVELATION:
Aeorian spores are causing the plague. They're byproduct of Salsvault's malfunctioning systems still pulsing magical energy into region.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMBAT ENCOUNTERS:

• Bandits at Croaker Cave (defending stolen artifacts)
• Corrupted creatures mutated by spore exposure
• Environmental hazards (avalanches, ice caves, magical malfunctions)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SALSVAULT EXPLORATION:

Party reaches buried Aeorian ruins. Massive underground city, partially intact but decaying:
• Malfunctioning magical systems still active
• Wandering magical constructs (confused, sometimes hostile)
• Evidence of pre-Calamity civilization
• Active arcane engine still pulsing energy

DISCOVERY:
This is the source of the Aeorian Echo affecting the frontier. The ruins are unstable and leaking magic.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:

1. EVACUATE: Party helps Palebank relocate to safer ground
   Consequence: Salsvault remains active, Echo continues

2. CLEANSE: Party attempts to stabilize/shut down the engine
   Consequence: Requires arcane expertise; may need Elric's help
   Risk: Unpredictable magical effects

3. EXPLOIT: Party seeks to use the engine's power for themselves or allies
   Consequence: Long-term complications; attracts attention of other factions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SCALING:

2 players: Fewer encounters, cave hazards instead of mass combat
3 players: Standard encounters
4–5 players: Additional corrupted creatures, tougher bandits

REWARDS:
• Aeorian artifacts (powerful or dangerous)
• Knowledge about Echo source
• Elric's gratitude (he studies the site)
• Variable gp based on resolution path

LORE IMPACT:
Party now knows: Aeorian magic is leaking into the world. This explains intelligent wolves, unstable artifacts, strange creatures everywhere. The frontier will be affected for years to come.]]></text></note>

<text>**LOCATION**: Palebank Village graveyard

**SITUATION**: Party arrives in Palebank Village just as the community gathers to pay final respects to Urgon Wenth, whose body has been transformed into an ice statue by frigid woe.

**SCENE OPENING**:
Snow gently falls from the sky and wind bites your cheeks as you stand in the graveyard of Palebank Village, a fishing outpost of Uthodurn that is home to several hundred dwarves and elves. The sun is low in the sky, sinking behind the fresh grave of Urgon Wenth, an old dwarf who caught a curse or disease that turned him into an ice statue. The folk of the village have gathered to pay their final respects to Urgon's frozen remains.

**ELRO ALDATAUR'S APPROACH**:
A gruff voice speaks softly from behind you. "Thank you for attending Urgon's service." You turn and meet the gaze of Elro Aldataur, a weathered elf, retired ranger, and the leader of the village. "I'm sorry to speak of dark tidings under such circumstances, but I believe that Palebank Village might be in danger, and I'm hoping you can help us."

**ELRO ALDATAUR** (Quest-Giver):
• Neutral Good, Male Wood Elf **Veteran** (MM p350)
• AC 17 (splint armor), HP 58 (9d8+18), Speed 35 ft.
• STR 16 (+3), DEX 13 (+1), CON 14 (+2), INT 10 (+0), WIS 11 (+0), CHA 10 (+0)
• Skills: Athletics +5, Perception +2, Survival +2
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12
• Languages: Common, Elvish
• **Multiattack**: Two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks
• **Longsword**: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d8+3 slashing (1d10+3 two-handed)
• **Longbow**: +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft., 1d8+1 piercing

**INFORMATION ELRO PROVIDES**:

1. **Urgon's Timeline**:
   - Two months ago, Urgon Wenth returned home after exploring Eiselcross for a year
   - Within days, strange affliction appeared: slow movement, blue veins across body
   - Village priests tried every healing spell—nothing worked
   - Urgon's condition worsened over weeks until body turned completely to ice

2. **Second Victim**:
   - Yesterday, Elro noticed **Tulgi Lutan** (dwarf trapper) showing identical symptoms
   - Tulgi refuses to speak with village authorities
   - She pushed Elro away, asking to "die in peace"
   - Elro fears the affliction could spread to entire village

3. **Why the Party**:
   - Glassblades (village militia) are warriors, not investigators
   - Tulgi distrusts authorities
   - Party of adventurers might have better luck gaining her trust
   - Elro hopes fresh perspective can uncover the truth

**ELRO'S REQUEST**:
"I need you to find out what caused Urgon and Tulgi's affliction before it spreads. Start by searching Urgon's cabin or talking to Tulgi. I'll pay you 100 gold pieces for answers—and more if you can find a cure."

**INVESTIGATION LEADS**:

**Starting Options**:
1. **Urgon's Cabin** (edge of village, guarded by Glassblade rookie Mila Teno)
2. **Tulgi's Cabin** (isolated location, Tulgi is inside and hostile)
3. **Pelc's Curiosities** (antique shop, if party asks villagers about Urgon's recent activities)
4. **Village Rumors** (talking to locals yields "Shaggy Wolf Stories"-style gossip)

**VILLAGE RUMORS** (DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) to gather):
- "Urgon came back with treasures from the frozen ruins of Eiselcross"
- "He sold everything to Verla Pelc at the curiosity shop"
- "Pelc's Curiosities was robbed two months ago—right after Urgon's sale"
- "Tulgi Lutan isn't from here—she and her sister came from Shadycreek Run"
- "People say the Lutan sisters work for criminals"
- "Verla Pelc hasn't been seen in weeks—shop's been closed"

**FRIGID WOE MECHANICS** (For DM Reference):

**Disease Transmission**: Creature contacts blue spores → DC 11 CON save or infected

**Incubation**: 1d4 days before symptoms manifest

**Symptoms**:
- Fatigue and chills
- Visible blue veins spread across body
- Speed reduced by 5 feet

**Progression**: Every 10 days after symptoms appear → DC 11 CON save or speed reduced by additional 5 feet

**Death**: If speed reduced to 0 → creature dies and turns into ice statue

**Cure**: Only drinking antidote (milky liquid in gold vials from Aeorian ruins) can cure the disease. Conventional healing magic fails.

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
- This is non-combat encounter focused on investigation and social interaction
- Elro is genuinely concerned and helpful
- Party can ask about Palebank Village, Eiselcross, local factions, or geography
- Elro knows about Croaker Cave but has no reason to suspect it yet
- If party mentions Uttolot family or Shadycreek Run, Elro becomes visibly worried

**NEXT STEPS**:
Party chooses which lead to follow:
- **Urgon's Cabin** (uid 2222)
- **Tulgi's Cabin** (uid 2223)
- **Pelc's Curiosities** (uid 2224)

**XP REWARD**: None (investigation encounter)

**STORY HOOKS**:
- Emphasis on ticking clock: Tulgi is dying
- Multiple villagers may already be infected without knowing
- Party may be exposed to spores during investigation
- Connection to Aeorian ruins establishes larger campaign threat

**TIMING**: 15-20 minutes of roleplay and information gathering</text>
</encounter>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Urgon's Funeral</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Adventure hook, establish stakes, introduce Elro Aldataur as quest-giver, set tone for mystery investigation.

**PACING**: Brief introduction (5 min), then direct party to investigation phase.

**KEY NPCS**:
- **Elro Aldataur**: Weathered elf leader, retired ranger, genuinely concerned for village safety
- **Mila Teno**: Young Glassblade guard, eager to help, will be encountered at Urgon's cabin

**INVESTIGATION PHILOSOPHY**:
This is medical mystery + criminal investigation hybrid. Party needs to:
1. Discover disease origin (Aeorian artifacts)
2. Track stolen relics (Uttolot bandits at Croaker Cave)
3. Find cure (journey to Salsvault)

**CLUE STRUCTURE**:
Linear with multiple paths:
- Urgon's cabin → Receipt → Pelc's shop → Tulgi/bandits → Croaker Cave
- Tulgi's cabin → Confession → Croaker Cave
- Village rumors → Either path

All roads lead to Croaker Cave eventually.

**DISEASE MECHANICS FOR DM**:
Don't reveal full mechanics immediately. Let party discover:
- Healing magic doesn't work (frightening!)
- Blue veins glow faintly in darkness
- Speed reduction is gradual
- Cure requires Aeorian antidote

**TENSION BUILDING**:
- Tulgi is dying (days remaining)
- Other villagers may already be infected
- Party might get infected during investigation
- Ticking clock creates urgency

**ELRO'S PERSONALITY**:
- Practical, direct, no-nonsense
- Cares deeply about villagers
- Trusts party because they're outsiders (objective)
- Will provide supplies, information, lodging
- Becomes long-term ally if party succeeds

**TIMING EXPECTATIONS**:
- Funeral scene: 5 minutes
- Elro's briefing: 10 minutes
- Village rumors: 5 minutes
- Total: 15-20 minutes before investigation begins]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Urgon's Cabin Search</name><uid>2222</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Urgon Wenth's cabin sits at the edge of Palebank Village, a modest one-room log structure that once belonged to an experienced explorer. A young wood elf in Glassblade uniform stands guard outside the front door.

She nods as you approach.

"Mila Teno," she introduces herself. "Elro said you might come. Be careful in there—someone already tore the place apart looking for something. We don't know who."

She opens the door for you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Edge of Palebank Village, Urgon Wenth's one-room log cabin

**SITUATION**: Party investigates the home of the first frigid woe victim, searching for clues about the disease's origin. The cabin has been ransacked by someone desperate for answers.

**GUARD AT THE DOOR**:
**Mila Teno** - Glassblade rookie
• Lawful Good, Female Wood Elf **Scout** (MM p349)
• AC 13 (leather armor), HP 16 (3d8+3), Speed 30 ft.
• STR 11 (+0), DEX 14 (+2), CON 12 (+1), INT 11 (+0), WIS 13 (+1), CHA 11 (+0)
• Skills: Nature +4, Perception +5, Stealth +6, Survival +5
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15
• Languages: Common, Elvish
• **Multiattack**: Two melee or ranged attacks
• **Shortsword**: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d6+2 piercing
• **Longbow**: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., 1d8+2 piercing

**Mila's Attitude**: Friendly and helpful. If party explains Elro sent them, she immediately allows entry. "Be careful in there. Someone already tore the place apart looking for something. We don't know who."]]>

**CABIN INTERIOR**:

READ ALOUD (Entering the cabin):

This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns. On the other side of the room, a small table strewn with dirty dishes and set with a dwarf-sized chair stands before two empty shelves whose contents are scattered across the floor: kitchen utensils, dried foodstuffs, adventuring gear, and a few books.

Someone has ransacked this place.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INVESTIGATION OPPORTUNITIES**:

**1. RANSACKED STATE** (Automatic):
Any character examining the mess realizes someone recently searched the cabin thoroughly. Shelves emptied, drawers overturned, belongings scattered.

**2. INTRUDER'S TRACKS** (DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)):
Success reveals muddy footprints leading in and out. Tracks are dwarf-sized, match Tulgi Lutan's boots. Trail leads back toward her cabin on village outskirts. Tulgi was desperate for any clues to cure herself.

**3. MOUNTED HEAD** (DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)):
Success identifies the trophy as a **yeti head**—a monstrosity found in Eiselcross's frozen wastes. Urgon was clearly an experienced explorer who hunted dangerous creatures.

Failure: Character recognizes it as some kind of arctic predator but can't identify species.

**4. ADVENTURING EQUIPMENT** (Automatic Find):
Among the scattered gear:
• **Silvered maul** (worth 100 gp, sized for dwarf)
• **Splint armor** (dwarf-sized, AC 17)
• **Bulky fur-lined clothing** (cold weather gear, dwarf-sized)
• **Grappling hook** and **hooded lantern**
• **Climber's kit** and **pitons**

Party can claim equipment if desired. Mila doesn't object: "Urgon has no family. Better you use it than let it rot."

**5. BOOKS AND RECEIPT** (DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation)):
Success while searching books reveals a **folded receipt** used as bookmark:

```
PELC'S CURIOSITIES - RECEIPT
Dated: 2 months prior

SELLER: Urgon Wenth
BUYER: Verla Pelc

ITEMS SOLD:
- Aeorian dagger (ornate, pre-Calamity)
- Scroll case (empty, engraved)
- Jade statuette (unknown deity)
- Quiver of twenty arrows (elvish make)
- Silver ring set with jasper
- Two blue glass vials (BEAUTIFUL CRAFTSMANSHIP)

TOTAL PAYMENT: 1,000 gold pieces
```

**6. URGON'S JOURNAL** (DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation), or automatic if party spends 10+ minutes searching):
Hidden under mattress, leather-bound journal with expedition notes:

**Key Entries**:
- "Day 47: Found entrance to buried structure beneath glacier. Aeorian architecture confirmed. City really existed!"
- "Day 52: Interior chambers partially intact. Magical lighting still functions after thousands of years. How?"
- "Day 58: Laboratories filled with glass containers. Most shattered. Found several intact vials—blue liquid inside, beautiful color."
- "Day 60: Taking samples back to Palebank. Verla will pay well for Aeorian relics."
- Final entry (two months ago): "Home at last. Sold collection to Pelc. Enough gold to retire comfortably. Never going back to that cursed ice."

**WHAT CHARACTERS LEARN**:

**Confirmed Facts**:
1. Urgon explored Eiselcross ruins (specifically Aeorian laboratories)
2. He found and brought back blue glass vials
3. He sold everything to Verla Pelc at Pelc's Curiosities 2 months ago
4. Someone (Tulgi) ransacked cabin looking for cure or clues
5. Urgon was infected shortly after returning

**Connections**:
• If party asks Mila or villagers about Pelc's Curiosities: "Oh, that shop was robbed two months ago! Verla hasn't been seen since. Some say she moved away, but her shop's still locked up."

**NEXT INVESTIGATION LEADS**:
1. **Follow Tulgi's tracks** → Tulgi's Cabin (uid 2223)
2. **Investigate Pelc's Curiosities** → Antique shop (uid 2224)
3. **Ask villagers about robbery** → Leads to Uttolot family rumors

**SKILL CHECK SUMMARY**:
• DC 10 Investigation: Find receipt
• DC 12 Investigation: Identify Tulgi's tracks
• DC 15 Investigation: Find Urgon's journal
• DC 15 Nature: Identify yeti head

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
- No combat in this encounter
- Emphasize eerie atmosphere: dead man's home, disease mystery
- Receipt is critical clue linking Urgon → Pelc → robbery → bandits
- Journal provides first concrete evidence of Aeorian origin
- Tulgi's tracks create urgency: she's dying and desperate

**TREASURE**:
• Silvered maul (100 gp)
• Splint armor, dwarf-sized (200 gp)
• Cold weather gear (10 gp)
• Climbing equipment (25 gp total)
• Urgon's journal (priceless lore)
• Receipt (critical clue)

**XP REWARD**: None (investigation encounter)

**TIMING**: 15-20 minutes of exploration and clue discovery

**TRANSITION**:
Party must choose next destination. Mila suggests: "If you're looking into Urgon's death, you should talk to Tulgi Lutan. She's the other one infected. Lives alone on the north edge of village—but I warn you, she doesn't like visitors."</text>
</encounter>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Urgon's Cabin</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Evidence gathering, establish Aeorian connection, provide crucial receipt clue, reward thorough investigation.

**PACING**: 15-20 minutes of careful searching. Don't rush players—let them feel like detectives.

**INVESTIGATION TIPS**:
- **Receipt is essential clue**: If party misses DC 10 check, have Mila say "Oh, did you check his books? Urgon loved reading while he ate."
- **Journal is bonus lore**: Provides context about Salsvault location, Urgon's personality, foreshadows Aeorian dangers
- **Tulgi's tracks**: Connect this scene to next encounter, show someone else is investigating

**MILA TENO'S ROLE**:
- Friendly NPC who helps party feel welcome
- Can answer questions about village, Urgon's reputation, recent events
- Knows about Pelc's Curiosities robbery but not about Uttolot connection
- Will warn party that Tulgi is "difficult" and "doesn't trust authorities"

**SKILL CHECK PHILOSOPHY**:
- Multiple ways to find each clue
- DC 10 checks are "you find this if you try"
- DC 15 checks reward players with good Investigation skills
- Automatic finds for players who search specific locations

**MOUNTED YETI HEAD**:
- Establishes Urgon as experienced Eiselcross explorer
- Foreshadows harsh arctic environment party will face
- Optional: If party removes head, worth 25 gp to right buyer

**EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY**:
- Mila won't stop party from taking Urgon's gear
- Cold weather gear becomes essential for Eiselcross journey
- Silvered maul useful against lycanthropes (if any in campaign)
- Splint armor is high-quality but dwarf-sized (may not fit party)

**CLUE CONNECTIONS**:
1. **Receipt** → Points to Pelc's Curiosities → Reveals robbery → Leads to Uttolot bandits
2. **Tulgi's tracks** → Shows she's desperate for cure → Points to Tulgi's cabin
3. **Journal** → Confirms Aeorian origin → Describes Salsvault location → Establishes danger level
4. **Blue vials mentioned** → Matches disease symptoms → Creates "aha!" moment

**ATMOSPHERE**:
- Dead explorer's home, frozen in time
- Ransacked but not violently—someone searched methodically
- Cold fireplace, unmade bed, dishes left mid-meal
- Eerie feeling: Urgon expected to come back

**TIMING**: Allow 15-20 minutes. If players are thorough, reward them with journal. If rushed, ensure they get receipt at minimum.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Tulgi's Cabin Interview</name><uid>2223</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching the cabin):

This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke pipes out of the chimney, indicating a roaring fire within.

The place feels... isolated. Deliberately so.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: North edge of Palebank Village, Tulgi Lutan's isolated one-room cabin

**SITUATION**: Party seeks information from the second frigid woe victim. Tulgi is dying, hostile to strangers, and doesn't want help—but she knows crucial information about the stolen Aeorian relics.

**APPROACHING THE CABIN**:

This snow-covered cabin looks peaceful and quiet from the outside. Its windows are shuttered, and a steady stream of smoke piping out of the chimney indicates a roaring fire within.]]>

**CABIN FEATURES** (if party needs to force entry):
• Roof: 12 feet high, DC 10 Strength (Athletics) to climb exterior walls
• Door: Locked, AC 15, 18 HP, immune to poison/psychic. DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) to pick lock, or DC 15 Strength (Athletics) to force open. Tulgi has key.
• Windows: Four shuttered windows (one per wall), latched from inside. DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) to unlatch from outside.
• Interior: Brightly lit by brazier and fireplace, but smoky haze makes interior lightly obscured.

**INITIAL CONTACT**:

READ ALOUD (If party knocks):

You knock. From the other side of the door, a harsh voice calls out:

"Go away! Let me die in peace!"

A woman's voice—but rough with pain or illness.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If party knocks, Tulgi calls through door: "Go away! Let me die in peace!"

**Social Challenge**: DC 12 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) convinces Tulgi to open door and allow entry.

**Success Examples**:
• Deception: "Elro sent us with a cure!" (risky—she'll be angry when it's not true)
• Intimidation: "Open up or we're coming in anyway. Your choice."
• Persuasion: "We're trying to stop this disease before it kills anyone else. Please help us save others."

**Failure**: Tulgi ignores them. Party must decide if they'll force entry (consequences with Glassblades if caught breaking in).

**TULGI LUTAN**:
• Neutral Evil, Female Mountain Dwarf **Thug** (MM p350) with modifications
• AC 11 (leather armor), HP 32 (5d8+10), Speed 10 ft. (reduced by frigid woe)
• STR 15 (+2), DEX 11 (+0), CON 14 (+2), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 11 (+0)
• Skills: Intimidation +2
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10
• Languages: Common, Dwarvish
• **Multiattack**: Two mace attacks
• **Mace**: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d6+2 bludgeoning
• **Heavy Crossbow**: +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., 1d10 piercing

**Visible Condition**: Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands. She shivers violently despite intense heat in cabin. Clearly dying.

**Pet Wolves**: **Iro** and **Jira**, two **Wolves** (MM p341) hiding under bed. If combat breaks out, wolves defend Tulgi until she's reduced to 10 HP (then she surrenders) or wolves are killed.

**INSIDE THE CABIN**:

READ ALOUD (If they convince Tulgi to open door or force entry):

The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze.

Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands like cracks in ice.

Two wolves lie beneath the bed, eyes gleaming in the firelight.

The dwarf woman glares at you.

"What do you want?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The heat in this small cabin hits like a hammer blow. A table set with neatly stacked dishes, tools, and utensils stands at the center of the room. The smell of a simmering soup comes from a pot hanging inside a roaring fireplace. Another fire burns in an iron brazier at the opposite end of the room, filling the cabin with a smoky haze. Shivering at the end of a bed near the brazier is a dwarf wrapped in blankets. Bulging blue veins streak her face, neck, and hands.

**FIRE HAZARDS**:
Any creature contacting brazier or fireplace for first time on turn (or starting turn there) takes 2 (1d4) fire damage.

**IF COMBAT OCCURS**:

• Tulgi attacks if party breaks in uninvited
• Fights until reduced to 10 HP, then surrenders
• Wolves (Iro and Jira) join fight immediately
• If party kills Tulgi, they lose crucial information (bad outcome)

**Wolf Stats** (each):
• AC 13, HP 11 (2d8+2), Speed 40 ft.
• **Bite**: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 2d4+2 piercing damage
• **Pack Tactics**: Advantage on attacks if ally within 5 ft. of target
• **Keen Hearing and Smell**: Advantage on Perception checks using hearing/smell

**INTERROGATION**:

**Initial Cooperation** (Tulgi gruff and defiant):
"I've got the same thing that killed Urgon. I'm looking for a cure. That's all you need to know."

**DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion)** convinces Tulgi to reveal full truth:

**Tulgi's Confession**:
1. **Criminal Background**: "My sister Hulil and I came here from Shadycreek Run few years back. We work for the Uttolot family."

2. **Watching for Treasure**: "Uttolots sent us to watch for artifacts coming from Eiselcross. Rich folks trying to smuggle relics past Uthodurn authorities. We steal them, fence them through Shadycreek."

3. **Urgon's Treasures**: "When Urgon came back with Aeorian relics, I saw my chance. Waited for him to sell to Pelc, then I robbed the shop."

4. **The Split**: "Gave most items to Hulil, but kept one for myself—an ornate dagger." (She grudgingly offers it if asked, or party notices it tucked under her shirt: DC 11 passive Perception)

5. **Hulil's Location**: "Hulil has the rest in **Croaker Cave**, north of here. Uses it as hideout with her bandit crew."

6. **Desperation**: "I'm the one who tore up Urgon's cabin. Thought he might've had magic, scrolls, something to cure this. Found nothing."

7. **Regret** (if party shows compassion): "I just wanted gold. Didn't know these things were cursed. Now I'm dying like Urgon... serves me right."

**WHAT TULGI DOESN'T KNOW**:
• How the disease is transmitted (spores in vials)
• That Hulil is also infected
• Location of antidote (Salsvault ruins)
• That her sister has sent bandits to ransack Pelc's Curiosities looking for cure

**TREASURE**:

**+1 Dagger** (if Tulgi gives it or party takes it):
• Hidden under her shirt (passive Perception 11 to notice)
• Ornate Aeorian craftsmanship
• DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or History): Confirms it's pre-Calamity relic from flying city of Aeor
• Worth 500+ gp to collectors, priceless to scholars

**DEVELOPMENT**:

**If Tulgi Cooperates**:
She provides directions to Croaker Cave and warns party: "Hulil's got at least five bandits with her. Maybe more. And she's tougher than me. Don't underestimate her."

**If Party Promises to Find Cure**:
Tulgi shows first sign of hope: "If... if you really can find cure, come back for me. I don't want to die as an ice statue."

**If Party Kills Her**:
Wolves flee. Party can find instructions from Hulil in Tulgi's belongings pointing to Croaker Cave. Lose moral high ground and potential ally.

**CONNECTIONS REVEALED**:
• Urgon's treasures → Stolen by Tulgi → Hulil now has them at Croaker Cave
• Uttolot family (Shadycreek Run criminals) → Organized smuggling operation
• Blue glass vials are among stolen items → Source of plague

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. **Croaker Cave** (uid 2225) - Find Hulil and recover infected vials
2. **Pelc's Curiosities** (uid 2224) - Investigate robbed shop (if not yet visited)

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
• Tulgi is hostile but not evil—she's a thief, not a murderer
• Emphasize her desperation and fear of dying
• If party shows compassion, she becomes more cooperative
• Combat should feel like tragic waste—she's already dying
• Wolves are loyal but will flee if Tulgi dies

**XP REWARDS**:
• Tulgi: 100 XP (only if killed in combat)
• 2 Wolves: 100 XP total (only if killed)
• Successful interrogation without combat: 200 XP (bonus for non-violent resolution)

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes (longer if combat occurs)

**DISEASE EXPOSURE RISK**:
If party spends more than 10 minutes in cabin's smoky interior and Tulgi has handled the dagger recently (she has), each PC must make DC 11 Constitution save or contract frigid woe. DM's choice whether to reveal this immediately or let symptoms appear later (1d4 days).</text>
</encounter>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Tulgi's Cabin</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Critical information source, moral choice (help dying woman vs. force information), first exposure to frigid woe victim up close.

**PACING**: 20-30 minutes. Can be tense negotiation or desperate combat.

**TULGI'S PSYCHOLOGY**:
- Dying and knows it
- Defiant but terrified
- Regrets her actions (infected herself through greed)
- Doesn't want pity, wants cure
- Loyal to sister Hulil despite everything

**PLAYER APPROACH OPTIONS**:

1. **Social (Persuasion)**: "We want to help. We're looking for cure too."
   - Appeal to shared goal
   - Promise to return with cure
   - Show genuine compassion
   
2. **Intimidation**: "Tell us what you know or we'll leave you to die!"
   - Works but makes party feel bad
   - Tulgi hostile afterward
   - Loses potential ally

3. **Deception**: "Elro sent us with the cure!"
   - Tulgi lets them in immediately
   - Becomes VERY angry when lie revealed
   - May attack out of rage/desperation

4. **Force Entry**: Break in without permission
   - Triggers combat immediately
   - Tulgi assumes they're Uttolot assassins
   - Wolves defend her
   - Risk killing critical information source

**COMBAT CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Tulgi has 10 ft. speed (frigid woe reduced movement)
- She's tough (32 HP, AC 11) but handicapped
- Two wolves make fight harder for low-level party
- Heat in cabin (brazier/fireplace) adds environmental danger
- Smoky haze creates lightly obscured conditions

**COMBAT AVOIDANCE**:
If combat begins but party calls for parley:
- DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) to stop fight
- "Wait! We're not here to kill you! We're investigating the disease!"
- Tulgi will listen if reduced to half HP or if party shows they could have killed her but held back

**THE DAGGER**:
Tulgi's +1 dagger is both treasure and evidence:
- Aeorian craftsmanship confirms Urgon's relics were authentic
- Tulgi touched it recently (frigid woe spores on hilt)
- Party handling it may require CON saves
- Valuable reward for peaceful resolution

**IRO AND JIRA** (Pet Wolves):
- Domesticated but loyal
- Won't attack unless Tulgi is threatened
- If Tulgi dies, they flee
- If party befriends Tulgi, wolves can become allies
- Represent Tulgi's softer side (she cares for animals)

**INFORMATION PACING**:
Tulgi reveals information gradually:
1. Initial: "I'm sick. Leave me alone."
2. With trust: "I worked for Uttolot family. I robbed Pelc's shop."
3. Full trust: "Hulil has the stolen goods at Croaker Cave. She's sick too."
4. With compassion: "I just wanted money. Didn't know artifacts were cursed."

**FRIGID WOE EXPOSURE**:
Party is at risk of infection:
- Tulgi has handled infected dagger
- Cabin air may contain residual spores
- Each PC in cabin 10+ minutes: DC 11 CON save
- Failure = infected (symptoms in 1d4 days)
- Creates personal stakes for finding cure

**MORAL WEIGHT**:
This encounter tests party's ethics:
- Help dying criminal? (She robbed innocent shopkeeper)
- Use force to get information? (She's already dying)
- Promise cure they're not sure exists? (Give false hope)
- Show mercy to Uttolot affiliate? (Criminals responsible for plague)

**OUTCOMES**:

**Best Case**: Party persuades Tulgi, gets full information, promises to find cure, takes dagger peacefully. Tulgi becomes grateful ally. XP bonus.

**Good Case**: Party intimidates Tulgi, gets information, relationship strained but functional. No bonus XP.

**Bad Case**: Party fights Tulgi, she dies, they find Hulil's orders in her belongings. Lose potential ally, miss dagger's lore.

**Worst Case**: Combat kills Tulgi and wolves before interrogation. Party has only vague clues about Croaker Cave location. Must investigate further or ask villagers.

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes. Combat adds 10-15 minutes.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching):

The dark cabin before you has a sign over its door which reads, "Pelc's Curiosities," with the image of a curving dragon used to make the letter P. Though the shop appears closed, the front door is slightly ajar.

From inside, you hear the faint sounds of movement—whispered voices and footsteps.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering the front shop):

Five cloaked elves appear to have ransacked the shop and are searching through the broken debris on the floor. The furniture, shelves, and front counter have been smashed, and the shop's wares now litter the floor.

They freeze as they notice you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Palebank Village, Verla Pelc's antique shop

**SITUATION**: Party investigates the robbed curiosity shop where Urgon sold his Aeorian relics. They'll find it's being searched again—this time by Hulil's bandits looking desperately for a cure. Verla Pelc is dead, her body turned to ice.

**APPROACHING THE SHOP**:

The dark cabin before you has a sign over its door which reads, "Pelc's Curiosities," with the image of a curving dragon used to make the letter P. Though the shop appears closed, the front door is slightly ajar.]]>

**Passive Perception 11+**: Hears whispered voices and footsteps coming from inside.

**Group DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth)**: Party can surprise bandits currently searching shop.

**BUILDING FEATURES**:
• One-story, two-room log cabin
• Windows shuttered and locked from inside (leaving interior dark)
• Only entrance is front door (slightly open)
• Back window can be forced with DC 12 Strength (Athletics), granting access to Verla's quarters

**FRONT SHOP AREA**:

Five cloaked elves appear to have ransacked the shop and are searching through the broken debris on the floor. The furniture, shelves, and front counter have been smashed, and the shop's wares now litter the floor.

**BANDITS** (5):
• Elf **Bandits** (MM p343) with modifications:
• AC 12 (leather armor), HP 11 (2d8+2), Speed 30 ft.
• STR 11 (+0), DEX 12 (+1), CON 12 (+1), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 10 (+0)
• Skills: None
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10
• Languages: Common, Elvish
• Fey Ancestry: Advantage on saves vs. charmed, immunity to magic sleep
• **Scimitar**: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1d6+1 slashing
• **Light Crossbow**: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., 1d8+1 piercing

**COMBAT TACTICS**:
• Bandits attack as soon as they notice party
• Fight until only 1 remains, then that survivor surrenders
• Use furniture debris as cover
• Crossbowmen stay at range, scimitar fighters engage melee

**DIFFICULT TERRAIN**: Debris covering floor makes entire front shop area difficult terrain.

**INTERROGATING CAPTURED BANDIT**:

DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) extracts following information:

1. **Employment**: "We work for Hulil Lutan, a dwarf priestess of Tiamat. She answers to the Uttolot family of Shadycreek Run."

2. **The Robbery**: "Hulil's sister Tulgi robbed this place two months ago. Took everything."

3. **Hulil's Condition**: "Hulil's sick. Same thing that killed the shop owner. Moving slow, blue veins all over. She's terrified."

4. **Current Mission**: "Hulil sent us back here to find potions, scrolls, anything that might cure her. We've torn this place apart—found nothing useful."

5. **Hideout**: "Hulil's at Croaker Cave with more bandits. North of village, on the shores of Frigid Depths."

6. **Shop Owner**: "The elf who owned this place? She's in the back room. Turned to solid ice. Same as that dwarf explorer."

**IF BANDITS NOT QUESTIONED**:
Party can find orders from Hulil on one bandit's body:

> *"Search Pelc's Curiosities again. Find healing potions, cure scrolls, anything. I'm dying. Don't fail me. — H.L."*

**VERLA'S QUARTERS** (Back Room):

READ ALOUD (Entering back room):

What appears to be an ice statue of an elf is bundled beneath the blankets of a bed along the east wall of the room. A small table loaded with dirty teacups and a kettle stands next to the bed.

The figure is frozen solid—translucent blue ice with bulging veins clearly visible beneath the surface. This was once a person.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**VERLA PELC** (Deceased):
The figure is Verla Pelc, unfortunate antique dealer. She was infected with frigid woe after handling Urgon's Aeorian relics. Symptoms appeared few weeks after robbery. Reclusive by nature, she never told anyone about illness. Died alone, body turned to ice.

**DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)** searching Verla's quarters:

**Success reveals**:
• **Personal journal** with business ledger
• Entry from 2 months ago: "Urgon Wenth sold me incredible finds from Eiselcross today. Aeorian artifacts! The blue glass vials are exquisite. I've never seen such craftsmanship. Will display them in front window."
• Entry from 6 weeks ago: "Robbed! Everything stolen. All my best pieces gone. Reported to Glassblades but they have no leads. That Uttolot woman's fingerprints are all over this."
• Entry from 1 month ago: "Feeling strange. Cold chills. Blue marks on my hands. Is this the same thing that killed Urgon?"
• Final entry (3 weeks ago): "Can barely move. Whatever curse those vials carried, it's killing me. Too weak to seek help."

**WHAT PARTY LEARNS**:

**Critical Intel**:
1. Verla died from same disease that killed Urgon
2. Both handled the blue glass vials from Aeorian ruins
3. Vials are source of infection
4. Hulil has the vials now and is also infected
5. Hulil is desperately searching for cure
6. Croaker Cave is next destination

**IMPLICATIONS**:
• Disease spreads through contact with vials (DM knows it's spores, but party hasn't identified transmission method yet)
• Multiple people infected: Urgon (dead), Verla (dead), Tulgi (dying), Hulil (dying)
• Anyone who touched vials is at risk
• Party needs to recover vials before more people are infected

**TREASURE**:

Among wrecked shop debris (DC 12 Investigation, 10 minutes searching):
• 50 gp in scattered coins
• Mundane antiques (plates, books, trinkets) worth 25 gp total
• **Healing Potion** (overlooked by bandits)

Verla's body:
• Silver locket with painted portrait (her mother, 10 gp)
• Shop ledger (historical value only)

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
• This is first major combat encounter in adventure
• Bandits are desperate but not suicidal
• Survivor provides crucial intel about Croaker Cave
• Verla's fate reinforces disease's lethality
• Party should realize they're racing against time

**XP REWARDS**:
• 5 Bandits: 125 XP total (25 XP each)
• Successful investigation: 50 XP bonus

**TIMING**: 30-40 minutes (including combat and investigation)

**TRANSITION**:

**Next Destination**: Croaker Cave (uid 2225)

Party now knows:
• Hulil has stolen vials at Croaker Cave
• Hulil is infected and dangerous
• Multiple bandits guard cave
• Need to recover vials to stop plague spread

**Optional Hook**:
If party returns to Elro Aldataur with this information, he offers additional 50 gp bonus and warns: "Croaker Cave is dangerous even without bandits. Giant ice frogs nest there. Be careful."</text>
</encounter>

<encounter><name>Croaker Cave - Entrance and Giant Ice Frogs</name><uid>2225</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching):

The rocky shore of the Frigid Depths stretches before you, waves lapping at ice-crusted stones. Ahead, a cave entrance roughly 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall at its highest point is set into a low cliff of grey stone. A thin plume of smoke rises from the ground beyond the cave entrance, venting through a narrow natural chimney about 30 feet back from the opening.

Someone's living in there.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering the cave):

The entrance opens into a natural chamber roughly 40 feet across. The floor is partially flooded with frigid water creating murky pools, and massive icicles hang from the ceiling like frozen fangs. The temperature inside is barely warmer than outside.

Then you hear it—a deep, resonant croak that reverberates off the stone walls.

Three massive frogs, each the size of a cart horse, rest in the pools. Their translucent blue-white skin seems to glow faintly in the dim light. Six bulging eyes slowly turn toward you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: North shore of Frigid Depths, natural cave entrance in rocky cliff face

**SITUATION**: Party approaches bandit hideout where Hulil Lutan has hidden the stolen Aeorian relics. The cave is home to dangerous giant ice frogs, and bandits have been careful to avoid disturbing them—but party's arrival might change that.

**APPROACHING THE CAVE**:

Characters local to Palebank or who've spent time there know of Croaker Cave by reputation. Any villager can provide directions: "Follow the northern coast road for two miles. You'll hear the cave before you see it—those ice frogs make an awful racket."]]>

**EVIDENCE OF BANDIT ACTIVITY**:
• Frequent tracks in snow where bandits have been coming and going (Survival DC 10)
• Discarded food scraps and frozen waste near treeline
• No visible guards or patrols (bandits stay inside cave for warmth)
• Smoke plume indicates active camp deeper in cave

**GIANT ICE FROGS** (3):
These massive amphibians nest in the cave entrance chamber. They're normally docile unless disturbed, but bandits have been careful to avoid them. Party's arrival will likely trigger encounter.

**GIANT ICE FROG** stats (each):
• Large Beast, Unaligned
• AC 11 (natural armor), HP 18 (4d10-4), Speed 20 ft., swim 40 ft.
• STR 12 (+1), DEX 13 (+1), CON 8 (-1), INT 2 (-4), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 3 (-4)
• Skills: Perception +2, Stealth +3
• Damage Vulnerabilities: Fire
• Damage Resistances: Cold
• Senses: Darkvision 30 ft., passive Perception 12
• Challenge: 1/4 (50 XP each)
• **Amphibious**: Can breathe air and water
• **Standing Leap**: Long jump up to 20 ft., high jump up to 10 ft. (with or without running start)
• **Bite**: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) piercing damage, and target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until grapple ends, target is restrained and frog can't bite another target.
• **Swallow**: If frog starts its turn with creature grappled, frog can use bonus action to swallow creature (size Medium or smaller). Swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks from outside frog, and takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at start of each of frog's turns. If frog takes 10+ damage on single turn from swallowed creature, frog must succeed DC 11 CON save at end of that turn or regurgitate creature (falls prone 5 feet from frog). If frog dies, swallowed creature no longer restrained and can escape corpse using 5 feet of movement (exits prone).
• **Ice Spray (Recharge 5-6)**: Frog exhales blast of freezing mist in 15-foot cone. Each creature in area must make DC 11 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) cold damage on failed save, or half on success.

**CAVE ENTRANCE LAYOUT**:

The entrance opens into a natural chamber roughly 40 feet across. The floor is partially flooded with frigid water (2-3 feet deep), creating pools where ice frogs nest. Icicles hang from ceiling. Temperature inside is barely warmer than outside.

**WATER POOLS**: Lightly obscured due to ice crystals and murky water. Difficult terrain. Creatures moving through water must succeed DC 10 DEX save or slip (movement ends, disadvantage on attacks until start of next turn).

**ICICLES**: Ceiling is 15 feet high with dozens of sharp icicles. If combat creates loud noise (thunder damage, explosions, etc.) or someone deliberately strikes ceiling, icicles fall. All creatures in 10-foot radius must succeed DC 12 DEX save or take 2d6 piercing damage.

**FROG BEHAVIOR**:

**Passive State** (if party is stealthy):
• Frogs rest in pools, occasionally croaking
• DC 13 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to pass through chamber without disturbing frogs
• Success: Frogs ignore party (they're used to bandits passing through)
• Failure: Frogs perceive party as threat and attack

**Aggressive State** (if disturbed):
• All 3 frogs attack nearest creatures
• Use Standing Leap to close distance quickly
• Prioritize Bite/Swallow on weakest-looking targets (light armor, small size)
• Use Ice Spray when 2+ targets are clustered
• Fight to death (too territorial to flee)

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:
• Frogs are dangerous for level 1 party due to Swallow ability
• Fire damage deals extra damage (vulnerability)
• Cold damage is reduced by half (resistance)
• Frogs have low AC but decent HP for CR 1/4
• Water terrain favors frogs (swim speed 40 ft. vs. difficult terrain for party)
• Party can avoid combat entirely with good Stealth

**COMBAT SCENARIO - BANDIT RESPONSE**:

If combat lasts more than 2 rounds OR party makes excessive noise:
• Bandits from deeper in cave investigate (2 rounds later)
• 2 **Bandits** arrive to check disturbance
• Bandits initially surprised to see intruders
• Shout warning back into cave: "Intruders! We're under attack!"
• More bandits arrive from uid 2226 encounter area

**STEALTH SCENARIO**:

If party successfully sneaks past frogs:
• Continue to deeper cave chambers (uid 2226)
• Potential surprise round against bandits
• Frogs remain in entrance area (won't pursue into bandit territory)

**ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS**:

**Frigid Water**: Creatures spending 10+ minutes in water without cold weather gear must succeed DC 10 CON save or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

**Slippery Ice**: All floors count as difficult terrain unless party moves carefully (half speed).

**Poor Lighting**: Entrance chamber is dim light from outside. Deeper into cave becomes darkness (need light sources).

**TREASURE**:

Frog nests contain indigestible remains of previous meals:
• 15 gp in various coins
• Broken fishing equipment
• Bones of unlucky animals and one humanoid skeleton
• **Potion of Cold Resistance** (in sealed flask, survived digestion)

**XP REWARDS**:
• 3 Giant Ice Frogs: 150 XP total (50 XP each)
• Stealth bypass: 100 XP bonus for avoiding combat

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes (10-15 if stealthed)

**TRANSITION**:

After dealing with frogs (combat or stealth), party proceeds deeper into cave toward bandit hideout (uid 2226).

**Smoke Plume Source**: Natural chimney vents from area C6 (Hulil's chamber) in deeper cave. Too narrow to climb (6 inches wide).

**Cave Map Reference**: Entrance leads to winding passages. Follow tracks and faint firelight glow to find bandit camp.</text>
</encounter>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Croaker Cave Entrance</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Environmental challenge, stealth test, resource management decision (fight or sneak), establish cave danger level.

**PACING**: 20-30 minutes with combat, 10-15 if stealth bypass.

**GIANT ICE FROGS**:
Territorial but not evil. They've been here long before bandits. Hulil's bandits have learned to "tame" them by feeding dead bats. Party has multiple options:

**APPROACH OPTIONS**:
1. **Stealth**: Sneak past frogs (DC 15 Stealth group check)
2. **Animal Handling**: Befriend frogs with food (DC 15, need bait)
3. **Combat**: Fight frogs head-on
4. **Distraction**: Create noise elsewhere, frogs investigate, party slips by
5. **Magic**: Sleep, charm, or similar spells

**FROG BEHAVIOR**:
- Territorial, not aggressive unless threatened
- Have learned to tolerate bandits (fed regularly)
- Will ignore party if they move slowly and non-threateningly
- Attack if startled, attacked, or if party spends too long in their territory

**COMBAT WARNINGS**:
- **Swallow** ability is DANGEROUS for level 1 PCs
- Small PCs (gnomes, halflings) are priority targets
- Frogs are smart enough to focus on one target at a time
- **Fire vulnerability** means fire spells are very effective
- **Cold resistance** means ice/cold spells are weak
- Water terrain favors frogs heavily

**STEALTH CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Group check required (all must succeed or highest roller helps lowest)
- Armor penalties apply (disadvantage in heavy armor unless Stealth proficiency)
- If party has light source, frogs automatically notice (darkvision vs. bright light)
- Success = surprise round against bandits in next area
- Failure = frogs attack, bandits hear combat and prepare

**ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**:
- **Frigid water**: Cold damage over time, exhaustion risk
- **Slippery ice**: Difficult terrain, Acrobatics checks to avoid falling
- **Dim lighting**: Entrance has some light, deeper areas pitch black
- **Natural chimney**: Smoke smell indicates deeper camp, but too narrow to use

**BANDIT ALERT SYSTEM**:
If combat lasts 2+ rounds:
- Bandits hear noise
- Send 2 scouts to investigate (arrive round 3-4)
- Scouts shout warning if they see intruders
- Main camp prepares ambush positions
- Party loses element of surprise

**REWARD STEALTH**:
Bypassing frogs grants:
- Surprise round in next encounter
- Conserved resources (HP, spells, abilities)
- XP bonus equal to frog combat XP
- Tactical advantage in bandit camp

**TREASURE PHILOSOPHY**:
Frog nests contain indigestible items from previous victims. Searching nests is gross but rewarding (Potion of Cold Resistance is valuable for Eiselcross journey).

**TIMING**: Combat = 20-30 min. Stealth = 10-15 min. Failed stealth then combat = 35-45 min.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Croaker Cave - Bandit Hideout</name><uid>2226</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The passage from the frog chamber winds deeper into the cave for about 60 feet before opening into a larger natural cavern. Warm orange light flickers against the stone walls—a campfire burns at the center of the chamber, casting dancing shadows across scattered bedrolls and supply crates.

Six figures huddle around the fire, their voices raised in argument. You catch fragments:

"We can't stay here much longer. Hulil's getting worse..."

"...cut our losses and head back to Shadycreek Run..."

"...failed, we're all dead anyway..."

They haven't noticed you yet.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Deeper chambers of Croaker Cave, bandit camp area

**SITUATION**: The Uttolot family bandits have set up temporary camp in the warmer interior chambers of Croaker Cave. They're on edge—Hulil is dying from frigid woe, supplies are running low, and they failed to find a cure at Pelc's Curiosities. When the party arrives, most bandits are gathered around campfire, arguing about what to do next.

**CAVE LAYOUT**:

The passage from the frog chamber winds for about 60 feet before opening into a larger natural cavern roughly 50 feet across and 20 feet high. This area has been converted into a crude camp:]]>

**CAMPFIRE**: Central feature, provides bright light in 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond. Smoke vents through natural chimney in ceiling.

**BEDROLLS**: 8 scattered around perimeter, currently 6 bandits present (2 died at Pelc's shop, 2 out on patrol).

**SUPPLY CRATES**: Stolen goods from various raids, food supplies (enough for 2 more weeks), rope, torches, basic camping gear.

**PASSAGES**: 
• Entrance from frog chamber (north)
• Passage to Hulil's quarters (south, 30 feet to uid 2227)
• Natural chimney (too narrow to climb)
• Small alcove with frozen stream (fresh water source)

**DEFENDERS**:

**6 BANDITS** (Uttolot family members and hired muscle)

**BANDIT** stats (each):
• Medium Humanoid (Human), Chaotic Evil
• AC 12 (leather armor), HP 11 (2d8+2), Speed 30 ft.
• STR 11 (+0), DEX 12 (+1), CON 12 (+1), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 10 (+0)
• Senses: Passive Perception 10
• Languages: Common, Thieves' Cant
• Challenge: 1/8 (25 XP each)
• **Scimitar**: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) slashing damage
• **Light Crossbow**: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8+1) piercing damage

**BANDIT COMPOSITION**:
• Garz (leader here, Tulgi's cousin)
• Fennick and Orvo (brothers, crossbow specialists)
• Rika (scout, keen hearing)
• Delos and Merrik (thugs, melee fighters)

**INITIAL SITUATION**:

When party arrives, bandits are:
• 4 sitting around campfire (Garz, Fennick, Orvo, Rika)
• 2 standing near supplies, checking inventory (Delos, Merrik)
• All are fatigued and demoralized
• Currently debating whether to abandon Hulil or make another supply run to Palebank

**OVERHEARD CONVERSATION** (if party approaches stealthily, DC 12 Perception):

Garz: "We can't stay here much longer. Hulil's getting worse. If those vials don't cure her, we're all dead men anyway—the family will kill us for failing."

Rika: "What about Tulgi? She hasn't reported back from the village."

Fennick: "Probably got caught or ran off. We should cut our losses and head back to Shadycreek Run."

Garz: "And tell the Uttolots we failed? You want to end up in the Graying Wildlands with a knife in your back?"

**STEALTH APPROACH**:

Party can attempt to surprise bandits with DC 13 group Dexterity (Stealth) check.

**Success**: Party gets surprise round. Bandits are scattered (not in defensive positions).

**Failure**: Bandits hear party coming. Rika shouts "Intruders!" Bandits grab weapons and take defensive positions.

**COMBAT TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: Bandits scramble for weapons and advantageous positions
• Fennick and Orvo grab crossbows, move to cover behind supply crates (half cover, +2 AC)
• Garz draws scimitar, moves to block southern passage (protects Hulil's chamber)
• Rika moves to alcove (attempts to flank party from side)
• Delos and Merrik charge nearest enemies with scimitars

**Round 2+**: Bandits fight defensively
• Crossbowmen focus fire on spellcasters/ranged attackers
• Melee fighters protect crossbowmen
• Garz holds position guarding Hulil's chamber
• If 3+ bandits drop, survivors attempt to retreat to Hulil's chamber (uid 2227)

**MORALE**:

Bandits are demoralized but afraid of Uttolot family retribution.

**Fight to death**: Garz (must protect Hulil)
**Fight until wounded**: Others fight until reduced to 3 HP or less, then attempt to surrender or flee

**SURRENDER CONDITIONS**:

If 4+ bandits are defeated and party has clear advantage:
• Remaining bandits drop weapons
• Garz shouts: "Wait! Stop! We surrender!"
• Willing to negotiate/provide information

**INTERROGATION** (if bandits surrender):

**DC 10 Intimidation or Persuasion** reveals:
• Hulil Lutan is in the southern chamber, dying from the same sickness that killed the dwarf
• They stole several items from Pelc's Curiosities, including two blue glass vials
• Hulil already drank one vial—made her sicker instead of curing her
• Second vial is still with Hulil in her chamber
• Items came from "some ancient ruin up north" according to Urgon's journal
• Uttolot family operates out of Shadycreek Run, sent them to watch for Eiselcross artifacts

**DC 15 Intimidation** additionally reveals:
• Hulil is a priestess of Tiamat, planning to use artifacts for ritual
• Family has contacts in Palebank (spy network)
• Several other teams searching for Aeorian artifacts across Wildemount

**ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES**:

**Campfire**: 
• Provides warmth (prevents cold exposure)
• Creatures entering or starting turn in fire take 1d4 fire damage
• Can be kicked over with action (creates 10-foot radius smoke cloud, lightly obscured for 1 round)

**Supply Crates**: 
• Medium objects, AC 15, 10 HP
• Provide half cover (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
• Can be pushed over with DC 12 STR check (creates difficult terrain)

**Frozen Stream Alcove**:
• Small 10-foot nook with frozen stream
• Can be used for cover or flanking position
• Ice is slippery (DC 10 DEX save or fall prone if running)

**Ceiling Height**: 20 feet, uneven rock with some stalactites

**TREASURE**:

**In Supply Crates**:
• 150 gp in mixed coins (stolen from various raids)
• **Urgon's Receipt** (evidence: "Sold to Verla Pelc: two blue glass vials (Aeorian), one carved runestone (Aeorian), misc. tools. Total: 1000 gp.")
• Food and supplies worth 50 gp
• 6 sets of thieves' tools
• 2 healing potions
• Smuggler's map showing route from Eiselcross to Palebank

**On Bandits**:
• 3 gp per bandit (18 gp total)
• Leather armor (6 sets)
• Scimitars (6)
• Light crossbows (6) with 20 bolts each

**SPECIAL LOOT**:
• **Uttolot Family Signet Ring** (on Garz): Silver ring with black gem, bear skull emblem. Worth 25 gp, but identifies wearer as Uttolot operative (could be useful or dangerous depending on context).

**XP REWARDS**:
• 6 Bandits: 150 XP total (25 XP each)
• Non-lethal resolution: +50 XP bonus for accepting surrender
• Information gathering: +25 XP for successful interrogation

**TIMING**: 30-40 minutes (20-25 if surprise round successful)

**TRANSITION TO UID 2227**:

After defeating/negotiating with bandits, party can:
• Proceed to southern passage (Hulil's chamber, uid 2227)
• Rest and recover (short rest possible if area secured)
• Search camp thoroughly (investigation, 10 minutes)

Garz warns party: "Hulil's not herself anymore. The sickness has driven her mad. She's armed and dangerous—and she won't surrender."

If any bandits escaped to Hulil's chamber, they warn her of party's approach (no surprise possible in uid 2227).</text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The southern passage opens into a roughly circular chamber, noticeably warmer than the rest of the cave. Brazier light flickers across the walls, casting long shadows that dance like serpents.

Against the eastern wall, a figure lies on a bedroll atop a raised stone platform, covered with furs. Even from here, you can see the bulging blue veins that streak across her exposed skin like cracks in ice.

On the western wall, a crude altar stands adorned with five candles, a copper bowl, and what appears to be a dragon skull carved from ice. The five flames flicker—almost like eyes watching you.

The woman on the bed coughs, ice crystals forming on her lips. She grips a mace in one hand and clutches an empty glass vial in the other. Her eyes are feverish but alert.

"You... you're the ones who killed my people."

Her voice is hoarse, rattling with each breath.

"Tulgi? Is she...?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Southern chamber of Croaker Cave, Hulil Lutan's personal quarters

**SITUATION**: Hulil Lutan, priestess of Tiamat and leader of this Uttolot operation, is dying from frigid woe. She drank one of the stolen Aeorian vials hoping it was a cure—instead it accelerated the disease. Now desperate and half-mad with fever, she guards the second vial and her hoard of stolen artifacts, convinced she can still complete her mission for the Uttolot family.

**CHAMBER DESCRIPTION**:

The southern passage opens into a roughly circular chamber 30 feet across with a 15-foot ceiling. Unlike the outer camp, this area shows signs of careful organization:]]>

**HULIL'S BEDROLL**: Positioned against eastern wall on raised stone platform, covered with furs. Hulil is currently lying here, visibly sick but alert.

**MAKESHIFT ALTAR**: Western wall features crude altar to Tiamat—five candles (representing five dragon heads), copper bowl for offerings, dragon skull carved from ice. Provides dim light.

**STOLEN ARTIFACTS**: Locked chest (DC 15 to pick) contains Urgon's stolen goods
• Two blue glass vials (Aeorian, one empty/one full)
• Carved runestone with pre-Calamity script
• Various Eiselcross expedition notes
• Small crystalline devices (magical but dormant)

**DEFENSIVE FEATURES**: Hulil has prepared this chamber for last stand
• Brazier provides bright light (10-foot radius) and dim light (20 more feet)
• Caltrops scattered near entrance (DC 15 Perception to spot, 1d4 piercing damage + speed halved until 1 HP of healing)
• Rope tied to stalactite as escape route to hidden exit (requires DC 12 Athletics to climb)

**TEMPERATURE**: Noticeably warmer than outer chambers due to brazier

**HULIL LUTAN - INFECTED PRIESTESS**:

**HULIL LUTAN** (Priest, modified):
• Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral Evil
• AC 13 (chain shirt), HP 22 (5d8), Speed 20 ft. (reduced from 30 ft. due to frigid woe)
• STR 10 (+0), DEX 10 (+0), CON 10 (+0), INT 13 (+1), WIS 16 (+3), CHA 13 (+1)
• Skills: Medicine +7, Persuasion +3, Religion +5
• Senses: Passive Perception 13
• Languages: Common, Draconic, Thieves' Cant
• Challenge: 2 (450 XP)

**SPECIAL CONDITION - FRIGID WOE (Stage 3)**:
• Speed reduced to 20 ft.
• Disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws
• Skin has bluish tint, ice crystals forming on extremities
• Will die and turn to ice statue in 1d4 days if not cured

**SPELLCASTING**:
Hulil is a 5th-level spellcaster. Spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).

**Cantrips** (at will): *Sacred Flame*, *Thaumaturgy*, *Guidance*

**1st level** (4 slots): *Cure Wounds*, *Guiding Bolt*, *Sanctuary*, *Shield of Faith*

**2nd level** (3 slots): *Spiritual Weapon*, *Hold Person*, *Lesser Restoration*

**3rd level** (2 slots): *Dispel Magic*, *Spirit Guardians*

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**:

**Divine Eminence**: When Hulil casts spell of 1st level or higher that restores HP, she or another creature within 5 ft. regains additional 2 HP.

**Tiamat's Blessing**: Once per day as bonus action, Hulil can invoke Tiamat's power. For 1 minute, her melee attacks deal extra 1d6 damage (type determined by rolling 1d5: 1=acid, 2=cold, 3=fire, 4=lightning, 5=poison). Already used today in desperation.

**ACTIONS**:

**Mace**: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage

**EQUIPMENT**:
• Chain shirt
• Silver holy symbol of Tiamat (worth 25 gp)
• Mace
• Healer's kit (5 uses remaining)
• Personal journal (details Uttolot operations, Eiselcross expeditions, Tiamat rituals)

**INITIAL STATE**:

When party enters, Hulil is:
• Lying on bedroll, clearly sick (bluish skin, labored breathing)
• Clutching empty blue vial in one hand, mace in other
• Eyes are feverish but alert
• Immediately recognizes party as threat to her mission

**OPENING DIALOGUE** (if party doesn't attack immediately):

Hulil coughs, ice crystals forming on her lips: "You... you're the ones who killed my people. Tulgi? Is she...?" 

*Waits for response*

"It doesn't matter. I'm dead anyway. But I won't die a failure. These artifacts belong to the Uttolot family. The Dragon Queen has shown me visions—these relics will restore Tiamat's glory!"

*Grips mace tighter*

"Leave now, or I'll drag you to the Hells with me."

**NEGOTIATION OPPORTUNITIES**:

Party can attempt to negotiate with DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check:

**Success**: Hulil hesitates. She's terrified of dying and Uttolot retribution, but also fevered and irrational. Party can potentially convince her to:
• Surrender and accept cure in exchange for information
• Reveal Uttolot family plans and Eiselcross operations
• Explain what the vials are and where they came from

**Failure**: Hulil interprets hesitation as weakness, attacks immediately

**DC 12 Intimidation** (if party demonstrates overwhelming force):
• Hulil recognizes she can't win
• Attempts to bargain: "Kill me if you want, but you'll never find the cure without me! I know where it came from—an Aeorian laboratory up north!"

**COMBAT TACTICS**:

Hulil fights desperately but intelligently:

**Round 1**:
• Casts *Shield of Faith* on self (AC becomes 15)
• Moves toward chest, attempting to grab second vial
• Shouts: "Tiamat, grant me strength!"

**Round 2**:
• Casts *Spiritual Weapon* (appears as spectral dragon head), attacks nearest enemy
• Uses mace to attack if enemy in melee range
• Attempts to drink second vial if wounded below 15 HP (see consequence below)

**Round 3+**:
• Casts *Spirit Guardians* if 2+ enemies nearby (dragon spirits swirl around her)
• Uses *Hold Person* on dangerous melee combatants
• Spiritual Weapon attacks each turn as bonus action
• Falls back toward hidden exit if reduced below 10 HP

**DESPERATION MOVE** (if reduced to 5 HP or less):
• Attempts to drink second blue vial
• "If I can't have it, no one can!" drinks vial
• **IMMEDIATE EFFECT**: Vial is NOT a cure—it's concentrated Aeorian disease vector. Hulil screams as frigid woe accelerates. Within 3 rounds, she turns into ice statue (dramatic death scene, no revival possible)
• Vial is destroyed, party loses potential evidence/cure lead

**PREVENTING VIAL CONSUMPTION**:
• Grapple Hulil (Athletics/Acrobatics vs. her Athletics +0)
• Disarm her (Attack action with disadvantage, or Disarming Attack maneuver)
• Kill her before she acts
• Use *Hold Person* or similar control spell

**MORALE**:

Hulil will NOT surrender unless:
• Reduced to 3 HP or less AND party offers healing/cure
• All escape routes blocked AND clearly outmatched
• Party mentions they can obtain cure from Salsvault (sparks hope)

**SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURE - BRAZIER**:

If combat involves fire spells or brazier is knocked over:
• Spilled coals create 10-foot diameter hazardous area
• Creatures entering or starting turn take 1d6 fire damage
• Provides opportunity to destroy stolen artifacts if party isn't careful

**HULIL'S JOURNAL**:

If recovered, contains crucial information:
• Urgon found ancient Aeorian laboratory in Foren called "Salsvault"
• Laboratory contained preserved biological weapons, magical stasis chambers
• Urgon sold two vials to Pelc—believed to be healing potions (WRONG)
• Hulil stole vials after Urgon died, thinking they were valuable cure
• Uttolot family paying premium for ANY Aeorian artifacts
• Mentions "Eiselcross expeditions becoming more frequent, competing factions searching for pre-Calamity weapons"
• Last entry (yesterday): "Drank first vial. Feel worse. What have I done? Must get to Salsvault and find real cure. Send word to family?"

**TREASURE**:

**In Locked Chest** (DC 15 Thieves' Tools):

Stone chest with dragon-face carving on outer lid contains:

• **One remaining blue glass vial** (Aeorian, contains frigid woe disease vector—NOT a cure)
• **Gilded scroll case** covered in cosmological map of multiverse (worth 15 gp)
• **Jade statuette of storm giant** (worth 25 gp)
• **Quiver containing six +1 arrows**
• **Silver ring set with jasper stone** (worth 50 gp)
• **Hulil's Wealth**: 415 cp, 234 sp, 43 ep, 112 gp (Aeorian coinage mixed with modern)
• **Receipt** indicating Hulil sold blue glass vial to Irven Liel for 100 gp
• **Bottle of Bald Dwarf Whisky** from Uthodurn (worth 25 gp, high-quality dwarven spirits)
• Urgon's expedition notes and maps showing Salsvault location

**Chest Trap**:
Pin-sized openings in dragon's mouth contain blue powder (frigid woe spores):
• DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) to find openings
• DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) to safely remove powder
• Failure: DC 11 Constitution save or contract frigid woe
• Detect magic reveals evocation aura
• Touching chest without speaking prayer to Tiamat triggers gust of wind
• If powder still present: 15-foot cube cloud, all in area DC 11 CON save or contract frigid woe

**On Hulil's Person**:
• Chain shirt
• Silver holy symbol of Tiamat (25 gp, religious significance to dragon cultists)
• Hulil's journal (critical information about Salsvault and Uttolot operations)
• Healer's kit
• Potion of Greater Healing
• Mace (used in combat)

**At Altar**:
• Dragon skull ice carving (masterwork, worth 100 gp to right buyer, melts in 1 hour if removed from cold)
• Copper offering bowl (5 gp)
• 5 candles
• Religious texts of Tiamat (no monetary value, but lore-rich)

**TOTAL VALUE**: Approximately 300+ gp in coins/gems, plus magical items (+1 arrows, magical ring, whisky, scroll case)

**XP REWARDS**:
• Hulil Lutan: 450 XP
• Preventing vial destruction: +50 XP
• Successful negotiation: +100 XP (instead of combat XP)
• Recovering journal and maps: +25 XP

**TIMING**: 30-45 minutes (including negotiation attempts)

**POST-ENCOUNTER INFORMATION**:

After defeating/negotiating with Hulil, party learns:

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**:
The blue vials are NOT cures—they're disease vectors. The actual cure must be at the source: Salsvault, an Aeorian laboratory in the Foren region of Eiselcross.

**URGENCY**:
Verla Pelc is already dead. Urgon is dead. Tulgi and Hulil are both dying or dead. Anyone infected in Palebank has limited time (1d4 days per stage, 3 stages total).

**NEXT STEPS**:
Party must:
1. Return to Palebank to report findings
2. Prepare for journey to Eiselcross
3. Travel to Syrinlya (Uthodurnian outpost)
4. Trek across frozen wastes to Salsvault
5. Find cure in ancient Aeorian laboratory

**OPTIONAL: SAVING HULIL**:

If party stabilizes Hulil and promises to find cure:
• She provides detailed information about Salsvault location
• Warns about environmental hazards in Eiselcross
• Offers to write letter to Uttolot family requesting temporary truce
• May become reluctant ally if cured (moral complexity)

**DM NOTE**: Decide based on party choices whether Hulil survives. Her knowledge makes journey easier, but she's also war criminal who participated in robberies and murder. Creates interesting roleplay tension.

**TRANSITION TO UID 2228**:

With Croaker Cave cleared and critical information obtained, party must return to Palebank Village to report to Elro Aldataur. He confirms Salsvault location from his research and helps arrange passage north to Eiselcross.

**Elro's Response**: "Salsvault... I've read fragmentary accounts. Pre-Calamity biological weapons facility. If the disease originated there, you'll need to venture into Foren—one of the most hostile environments in all of Wildemount. I'll arrange for supplies and contacts at Syrinlya."

This concludes the Palebank Village investigation phase. Next: Journey north to frozen continent.</text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Departing Palebank):

The *Frostbreaker* rocks gently at Palebank's small dock as Captain Tarina Sorven oversees final preparations. The reinforced fishing vessel looks sturdy but weathered, its hull scarred by countless encounters with arctic ice.

Tarina glances at the horizon, where gray clouds gather like a distant army.

"Weather's been strange lately," she says, her breath misting in the frigid air. "Magical storms out of season. I'll get you there, but no guarantees about when we can return."

She fixes you with a hard stare.

"Eiselcross has a way of keeping people."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Day 2 - Magical Storm):

Around midday, the sky transforms. Purple-black clouds boil up from the horizon with unnatural speed, and green-tinged lightning crackles across the heavens like veins of poison.

The temperature drops even further. Ice forms on the rigging in seconds.

Captain Tarina's face goes pale.

"Everyone secure! This is a Calamity storm—they come from nowhere and disappear just as fast!"

The first wave hits like a giant's fist.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Day 3 - Approaching Eiselcross):

The storm has passed. The sky clears to a pale, watery blue.

And then you see it.

The Eiselcross coastline rises before you like the corpse of a frozen god. Towering glaciers hundreds of feet high, jagged ice formations that catch the light in shades of blue and white, a desolate landscape that seems to swallow all warmth and hope.

Even from the boat, you can feel it—this place is wrong. The scars of the Calamity run deep here.

Ahead, clinging to a glacier shelf like a stubborn barnacle, you see Syrinlya. A fortified outpost of stone and ice, watchtowers rising against the white expanse.

Survival. That's what this place promises. Nothing more.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Frigid Depths (sea travel) from Palebank Village to Syrinlya outpost on Foren (Eiselcross)

**SITUATION**: After reporting findings to Elro Aldataur, party secures passage north to Eiselcross. The journey takes 3 days by boat across treacherous arctic waters. This encounter covers travel challenges, environmental hazards, and potential random encounter.]]>

**PREPARATION IN PALEBANK**:

Before departure, Elro Aldataur provides:
• Letter of introduction to Morgo Delwur (Uthodurnian commander at Syrinlya)
• Warning about extreme cold in Eiselcross
• Recommendation to purchase cold weather gear if not already owned
• Information about Salsvault location (roughly 50 miles inland from Syrinlya)

**Elro's Warning**: "Eiselcross isn't like the cold you've experienced here. It's a frozen wasteland where the Calamity's scars still linger. Magical storms, pre-Calamity horrors, and terrain that can kill you in minutes. Take every precaution."

**REQUIRED SUPPLIES**:

**Cold Weather Gear**: 10 gp per person (if not already owned). Without this gear, characters make CON saves at disadvantage and gain exhaustion faster in extreme cold.

**Rations**: 10 days minimum recommended (1 day = 5 sp)

**Healing Supplies**: Potions, healer's kits (medical emergencies in arctic)

**Optional Gear** (available in Palebank):
• Rope (50 ft.): 1 gp
• Pitons (10): 5 sp
• Crampons: 5 gp (advantage on checks to avoid slipping on ice)
• Snowshoes: 2 gp (ignore difficult terrain from snow)
• Polar bear fur blanket: 25 gp (advantage on saves against extreme cold during rest)

**BOAT PASSAGE**:

**Captain Tarina Sorven** (Scout stats) operates the *Frostbreaker*, a reinforced fishing vessel converted for Eiselcross expeditions.

**Cost**: 50 gp per person (one-way), 80 gp per person (round-trip with return date arranged)

**Tarina's Warning**: "Weather's been strange lately. Magical storms out of season. I'll get you there, but no guarantees about when we can return. Eiselcross has a way of keeping people."

**JOURNEY - DAY 1**:

The *Frostbreaker* departs Palebank at dawn. Initial sailing is calm but bitterly cold.

**Weather**: Overcast, light snow, wind 15 mph, temperature 10°F

**Activity**: Party can rest, prepare equipment, discuss strategy

**Random Encounter Check**: Roll 1d6. On 1, encounter **Ice Mephits** (3) that formed near the boat from magical cold. They're curious rather than hostile initially, but attack if provoked or offered warmth (fire). AC 11, HP 21 each, CR 1/2.

**Evening Camp**: Boat anchors near ice floe for night. Party can take watch shifts.

**Night Watch DC 12 Perception**: 
• Success: Spot distant lights on horizon (other expedition ship, or will-o'-wisp)
• Failure: Uneventful night

**JOURNEY - DAY 2**:

Weather deteriorates as boat enters more treacherous waters near Eiselcross.

**Weather**: Heavy snow, wind 25 mph, temperature 0°F, visibility reduced to 60 feet

**Challenge - Magical Storm**:

Around midday, unnatural storm forms rapidly. Green-tinged lightning crackles across purple-black clouds. This is an echo of Calamity-era weather magic.

**Captain Tarina shouts**: "Everyone secure! This is a Calamity storm—they come from nowhere and disappear just as fast!"

**STORM SURVIVAL CHALLENGE** (skill challenge, 4 successes before 3 failures):

Party members can contribute using various skills:

**Athletics DC 13**: Help secure rigging, tie down cargo, bail water
**Acrobatics DC 13**: Maintain balance on pitching deck, avoid being swept overboard
**Survival DC 12**: Predict storm patterns, advise captain on safest course
**Arcana DC 15**: Recognize magical nature, potentially disrupt storm with *Dispel Magic* (counts as automatic success)
**Nature DC 14**: Read natural signs, identify breaks in weather

**Success (4 before 3 failures)**: 
• Party successfully weathers storm
• Boat takes minor damage but remains seaworthy
• No casualties
• Storm passes after 2 hours

**Failure (3 failures before 4 successes)**:
• Boat takes significant damage (sail torn, hull breached slightly)
• Each character must make DC 12 DEX save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from flying debris
• One party member swept overboard (must be rescued with DC 13 Athletics check or 50-foot rope throw)
• Delays arrival by 1 day while repairs are made

**ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT - EXTREME COLD**:

All characters without cold weather gear must succeed DC 10 CON save or gain 1 level of exhaustion during storm.

**JOURNEY - DAY 3**:

Weather clears. Eiselcross coastline becomes visible—towering glaciers, jagged ice formations, desolate landscape.

**Weather**: Clear skies, wind 10 mph, temperature -10°F, visibility excellent

**Captain Tarina points ahead**: "There. Syrinlya. Welcome to the end of the world."

**Approaching Syrinlya**:

The Uthodurnian outpost appears as collection of reinforced buildings carved into glacier shelf, with watch towers and defensive walls. Purple and gold banners (Uthodurn colors) fly from central building.

**Harbor**: Small ice-free harbor maintained by magical heating stones (Uthodurnian engineering)

**Activity**: Several other boats docked—mix of expedition vessels, supply ships, and ice fishing boats

**Boat anchors safely. Journey complete.**

**ARRIVAL PROTOCOL**:

**Harbor Guard** (2 **Guards** in cold weather gear) meet party at dock:

"State your business in Syrinlya. This is Uthodurnian territory under military authority."

Party must present:
• Elro Aldataur's letter of introduction (automatic success)
• OR explain situation and succeed DC 12 Persuasion check
• OR pay 10 gp "expedition registration fee"

**Success**: Guards escort party to Commander Morgo Delwur (uid 2229)

**Failure**: Guards deny entry, party must camp outside outpost (make encounter more difficult)

**OPTIONAL RANDOM ENCOUNTER - POLAR HORROR**:

If you want additional challenge during Day 3:

**Polar Worm** surfaces near boat (Remorhaz reskin, CR 11 - scale to party level or make flee/avoid encounter):

Massive segmented worm breaks through ice 200 feet from ship. Its hide radiates intense heat, melting ice around it. The creature is hunting seals but could perceive boat as threat.

**Captain Tarina panics**: "POLAR WORM! Don't engage—they're death incarnate! Hold still!"

**Group Stealth DC 14**: Party and crew remain silent and motionless. 
• Success: Worm loses interest, submerges
• Failure: Worm investigates boat (potential combat)

**Alternative**: Worm attacks but Captain Tarina uses ship's ballista (NPC action) to drive it off after 2 rounds, creating dramatic scene without full combat.

**XP REWARDS**:
• Successful journey: 100 XP
• Storm challenge success: +50 XP
• Ice Mephit encounter (if occurs): 300 XP (100 each)
• Polar Worm avoidance: +100 XP

**TIMING**: This represents 3 in-game days. At table, should take 20-30 minutes including roleplay and challenges.

**TREASURE**: None directly, but Captain Tarina may offer discount on return voyage if party helps during storm (reduce return fare by 20 gp per person).

**TRANSITION TO UID 2229**:

Party disembarks at Syrinlya harbor and proceeds to meet Commander Morgo Delwur to arrange supplies and guide for trek to Salsvault.

**Setting**: Syrinlya is grim military outpost, not a welcoming town. Expedition culture means merchants and soldiers are practical, even cynical. Survival comes first, profits second, everything else distant third.</text>
</encounter>

<encounter><name>Syrinlya Outpost</name><uid>2229</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Arriving at Syrinlya):

Syrinlya clings to the glacier shelf like a fortress under siege. Twenty-foot stone walls reinforced with ice surround the compound, and watch towers rise at each corner, their ballistas trained on the frozen wastes beyond.

As you disembark, the cold hits differently here—sharper, hungrier, unnatural. This isn't weather. This is the Calamity's lingering curse.

Guards in heavy armor wave you through the gate. Inside, the outpost bustles with grim activity—soldiers on patrol, merchants hawking supplies, researchers poring over maps. Everyone here has the same look: determination mixed with the knowledge that they might not leave this place alive.

A dwarf sergeant approaches.

"Commander Delwur is expecting you. This way."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Meeting Commander Morgo):

Commander's Hall is a sparse room dominated by maps of Eiselcross covering every wall. A fireplace crackles in the corner, and a mounted yeti head glares down from above the mantle.

Behind a worn desk sits Commander Morgo Delwur—a dwarf with more scars than beard, his eyes hard as the ice outside.

He looks up from paperwork.

"More treasure hunters? We get twenty a month. Half don't come back."

He reads Elro's letter, and something shifts in his expression.

"Elro Aldataur... I remember him. Good scholar."

He studies you carefully.

"Says you're on legitimate business, not just looting. Salsvault, eh? That's 50 miles inland through the deadliest terrain on this continent."

He leans back.

"What's worth that risk?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Syrinlya - Uthodurnian military outpost on Foren coast, Eiselcross

**SITUATION**: Party arrives at Syrinlya seeking supplies, information, and potential guide for trek to Salsvault. This is primarily a roleplay/exploration encounter with opportunities to gather resources and intelligence about the journey ahead.]]>

**OUTPOST DESCRIPTION**:

Syrinlya is a fortified settlement of approximately 150 people—mostly Uthodurnian soldiers, expedition merchants, researchers, and fortune seekers. Built into a glacier shelf, the outpost features:

**MAIN BUILDINGS**:
• **Commander's Hall**: Central command post (Morgo Delwur's office)
• **Barracks**: Housing for 80 soldiers
• **Supply Depot**: Military and civilian supplies
• **Trading Post**: Merchant quarter (3-4 shops)
• **Researcher's Lodge**: Dusty Shelf (Cobalt Soul) outpost
• **Tavern**: "The Frozen Hearth" (warmth, food, drink, gossip)
• **Docks**: Small harbor with magical heating

**DEFENSES**:
• 20-foot stone walls reinforced with ice
• 4 watch towers with ballistas
• Magical warning wards (detect hostile creatures within 100 feet)
• Garrison of 60 active soldiers + 20 reserves

**ATMOSPHERE**: 
Grim determination. Everyone here is either hunting for treasure, conducting research, or defending against Eiselcross horrors. Mortality rate is high. Newcomers are viewed with mixture of pity and opportunism.

**KEY NPC - COMMANDER MORGO DELWUR**:

**MORGO DELWUR** (Veteran stats, modified):
• Male Dwarf, age 186, Lawful Neutral
• Uthodurnian military, 40 years' service
• Gruff but honorable, respects competence
• Weary from constant expedition disasters
• AC 17 (splint armor), HP 58, CR 3

**Meeting with Morgo**:

Guards escort party to Commander's Hall—a sparse room with maps of Eiselcross covering walls, fireplace crackling, trophy mounted yeti head.

Morgo looks up from paperwork: "More treasure hunters? We get twenty a month. Half don't come back." *Reads Elro's letter* "Elro Aldataur... I remember him. Good scholar. Says you're on legitimate business, not just looting." *Studies party* "Salsvault, eh? That's 50 miles inland through the deadliest terrain on this continent. What's worth that risk?"

**Conversation Options**:

**1. Explain Disease Situation** (Persuasion DC 12):
• Success: Morgo softens. "Disease outbreak? That's serious. We've had outbreaks here—nasty business. I'll help where I can."
• Grants access to military supplies at cost
• Offers map of known safe routes
• Failure: Remains skeptical but doesn't refuse aid

**2. Request Guide** (Persuasion DC 15):
• Success: "I can't spare soldiers, but there's a ranger who knows the area. Irven Liel. Find him at the Frozen Hearth. Tell him I sent you—he owes me a favor."
• Failure: "I have 60 soldiers protecting 150 civilians. Can't spare anyone. Hire a guide from the tavern if you can find one foolish enough."

**3. Ask About Salsvault**:
Morgo shares freely:
• "Pre-Calamity weapons facility. Uthodurnian scouts mapped exterior 5 years ago but didn't enter—too dangerous."
• "Magical protections still active. Constructs, traps, and worse."
• "Other factions are searching for it. Cerberus Assembly, Myriad, even Dwendalian military. You won't be alone out there."
• Provides rough map showing Salsvault location (50 miles northwest)

**4. Warn About Uttolot Family** (if party mentions them):
• "Shadycreek Run criminals. We've caught a few of their operatives. Eiselcross is lawless—they operate freely in the interior."
• "If they're after Aeorian artifacts, that's trouble. Those relics are weapons, not treasure."

**SUPPLIES AVAILABLE**:

**At Commander's Hall** (military discount if Morgo approves):
• Healing Potion: 50 gp (25 gp with discount)
• Healer's Kit: 5 gp
• Rope (50 ft.): 1 gp
• Pitons (10): 5 sp
• Rations (10 days): 5 gp

**At Trading Post** (standard prices):
• Greater Healing Potion: 250 gp
• Potion of Cold Resistance: 100 gp (high demand, limited stock)
• Crampons: 5 gp (advantage on ice terrain checks)
• Snowshoes: 2 gp (ignore snow difficult terrain)
• Climbing gear bundle: 25 gp (rope, pitons, harness)
• Arctic survival kit: 50 gp (tent, furs, fire starting tools)

**RESEARCHER'S LODGE - DUSTY SHELF OUTPOST**:

**Prolix Yusaf** (Acolyte stats), gnome archivist for Cobalt Soul.

Prolix is eager for information about Aeorian sites:

"Salsvault! Oh my, yes, we have fragmentary records. Pre-Calamity biological research facility. The Aeorians were experimenting with diseases as weapons—quite unethical, really, but fascinating from a historical perspective."

**DC 12 Persuasion or offering to share findings**:
Prolix provides:
• Detailed map of Salsvault exterior (architectural layout)
• Warning: "Central chamber contains what records call an 'Arcane Perpetuation Engine'—likely source of disease. Disable it carefully!"
• Copy of partial Aeorian text about biological stasis fields
• Request: "Bring back any intact documents or artifacts. The Cobalt Soul will compensate you generously."

**THE FROZEN HEARTH - TAVERN**:

Run by **Masilda Freck** (Commoner), elderly human who's seen countless expeditions come and go.

**Atmosphere**: Warm (relatively), crowded, smells of stew and ale. Trophy heads on walls. Maps and expedition notices posted on board.

**Patrons** (potential roleplay):
• Failed treasure hunters drowning sorrows
• Soldiers off-duty
• Merchants negotiating deals
• Researchers arguing about Aeorian history

**RUMORS AT THE TAVERN** (Persuasion DC 10 or buying round of drinks, 5 gp):

Roll 1d6 or choose:
1. "Expedition from Rexxentrum disappeared near Salsvault two months ago. Twenty soldiers, gone without trace."
2. "Animated constructs patrol the ruins. Bronze and strange glass, pre-Calamity make. Deadly."
3. "Magical storm hit the interior last week. Green lightning, reality warping. Calamity scars are getting worse."
4. "Myriad has a camp 30 miles north. They're digging up something big. Military can't touch them—no jurisdiction."
5. "Local ranger named Irven Liel knows the area. Expensive but reliable. Lost half his team to an Aeorian golem last year."
6. "The ice preserves everything. Bodies from the Calamity, still frozen after 800 years. Some expeditions find them... still alive, somehow. Babbling in ancient languages."

**KEY NPC - IRVEN LIEL** (if party seeks guide):

**IRVEN LIEL** (Scout stats, modified):
• Male Half-Elf, age 37, Chaotic Good
• Former military scout, now freelance guide
• Knows Salsvault area from previous expedition
• Survived encounter with Aeorian construct (has scar)
• AC 13 (leather armor), HP 16, CR 1/2

**Negotiation**:
"Salsvault? You're either brave or stupid. I've been near there—lost three friends to the constructs. I'll guide you for 200 gold, paid upfront. If we find valuable artifacts, I want 10% share."

**Persuasion DC 14**: Reduce fee to 150 gp
**Intimidation DC 16**: Reduce to 100 gp (but Irven is resentful, may abandon party if things get dangerous)
**If party mentions Morgo's favor**: Reduce to 100 gp willingly, good attitude

**Irven's Services**:
• Knows safe route to Salsvault (avoids major hazards)
• Can identify dangerous creatures by tracks
• Provides advantage on group Survival checks during trek
• Warns about territorial ice trolls and yetis
• Won't enter Salsvault interior ("I'm a guide, not a dungeon delver. I'll get you there and back, but you're on your own inside.")

**REST AND PREPARATION**:

Party can take long rest in Syrinlya before departing:
• Room at Frozen Hearth: 5 gp per night (includes meals)
• Barracks cot (if Morgo approves): Free

**Preparing for Trek**:
DM should ensure party has:
• Cold weather gear (essential)
• Adequate healing supplies
• Food and water (10+ days recommended)
• Climbing equipment (useful for glaciers and ruins)
• Light sources (Salsvault interior is dark)

**OPTIONAL ENCOUNTER - MYRIAD AGENT**:

If you want to foreshadow faction conflict:

**Veka Shenn** (Spy stats), human woman, approaches party discreetly:

"I hear you're heading to Salsvault. My employers would pay well for information about what you find. No obligation—just a friendly offer. Here's how to contact me." *Hands party sending stone address*

If party refuses: "Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, the Myriad rewards cooperation... and punishes interference."

Not combat encounter, but adds moral complexity and potential future complications.

**XP REWARDS**:
• Successful negotiation with Morgo: 100 XP
• Obtaining detailed information from Prolix: 50 XP
• Hiring Irven Liel: 25 XP
• Gathering tavern rumors: 25 XP

**TIMING**: 30-45 minutes (includes shopping, conversations, rest)

**TRANSITION TO UID 2230**:

After preparations complete, party departs Syrinlya with or without Irven Liel, heading northwest into Eiselcross interior toward Salsvault.

**Morgo's Farewell**: "Good luck out there. If you don't return in ten days, I'll assume you're dead and send salvage team. Try not to become ice statues."

**Irven's Warning** (if hired): "Stay close, keep quiet, and don't touch anything that glows. Eiselcross has killed better adventurers than you."

The frozen wasteland awaits.</text>

<text>READ ALOUD:

The first night on the glacier is colder than anything you've experienced. Even huddled around the campfire, your breath fogs white in the darkness. The wind howls across the ice fields, carrying with it an eerie, lonely sound.

Then the howling changes. It's no longer just the wind.

Two shapes emerge from the darkness, prowling at the edge of your firelight. Massive wolves, their fur pure white, their eyes glowing pale blue. They circle your camp with unnerving intelligence, sizing you up.

These are winter wolves—and they're hunting.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Eiselcross interior, Day 1 of trek to Salsvault

**SITUATION**: During the night watch at the party's first camp on the frozen glacier, two **Winter Wolves** detect the campfire and investigate. These intelligent, evil creatures see the party as potential prey.

**TIMING**: Night of Day 1, during watch rotation

**DETECTION**:

**Passive Perception 13** (or active Perception DC 15):
• Spot two shapes moving across the ice 120 feet away
• Glowing eyes reflecting firelight
• Wolves are attempting to approach stealthily

**Wolves' Stealth**: +3 with advantage (Snow Camouflage) = +5 to +8 total

**APPROACH**:

Winter Wolves are intelligent (Int 7, speak Common, Giant, Winter Wolf) and tactical. They:
• Circle campfire at 120-foot distance, assessing party
• Use Pack Tactics to coordinate
• Target weakest-looking party member (unarmored, isolated, small)
• Use terrain (ice formations, snow drifts) for cover

**COMBAT TACTICS**:

**Round 1 - Ambush**:
• Wolves charge from two different directions (split party attention)
• Each wolf targets different party member
• Use Bite attacks, attempt to knock prone (DC 14 STR save)
• If target knocked prone, Pack Tactics grants advantage on subsequent attacks

**Round 2 - Breath Weapons**:
• If 2+ party members are clustered, wolves use Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)
• 15-foot cone, DC 12 DEX save, 18 (4d8) cold damage
• Wolves immune to each other's cold damage

**Round 3+ - Sustained Attack**:
• Focus fire on weakest/most injured target
• Use 50-foot movement to stay mobile, avoid area effects
• Fight to death (territorial predators, won't flee)

**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS**:

**Campfire Advantage**: Party has bright light in 20-foot radius, can see wolves clearly. Wolves don't care—they hunt in all conditions.

**Cold Exposure**: Characters without cold weather gear already at risk. Taking cold damage increases danger.

**Watch Rotation**: Only characters on watch are awake at start of combat. Sleeping characters must use action to wake up (unless someone shouts alarm).

**ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES**:

**Campfire**: Provides warmth and light. Can be used as weapon—shove burning log at wolf (improvised attack, 1d4 bludgeoning + 1d4 fire).

**Ice Formations**: Scattered around camp. Medium objects, provide half cover (+2 AC).

**Slippery Ice**: Entire battlefield is difficult terrain unless party specifically prepared area.

**TREASURE**:

Winter Wolves carry no treasure, but their pelts are valuable:
• Each pelt worth 100 gp to furrier in Syrinlya
• Can be used to craft cold-resistant cloak (requires downtime + 50 gp materials)

**XP REWARDS**:
• 2 Winter Wolves: 1,400 XP total (700 XP each)

**CONSEQUENCES**:

**If party defeats wolves**:
• Gain confidence for remainder of trek
• Irven (if present) impressed: "You handled those well. Maybe you'll survive Salsvault after all."

**If wolves deal significant damage**:
• Party forced to use healing resources early
• May need to rest longer before continuing trek

**If party takes casualties**:
• Serious risk to expedition
• Irven may suggest returning to Syrinlya (if present)

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes at table

**TRANSITION**:

After combat, party can:
• Take short rest to recover (use Hit Dice)
• Continue watch rotation (remaining night uneventful)
• Resume trek at dawn toward Salsvault

**Irven's Comment** (if present):
"Winter Wolves hunt in packs. Where there are two, there might be more. We should move on as soon as you're able."</text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Departing Syrinlya):

The gates of Syrinlya close behind you with a heavy finality. Ahead stretches an endless expanse of white—glacier fields, ice plains, and frozen forests that seem to go on forever.

The wind bites like a living thing. The cold here isn't natural—it's hungrier, sharper, older. This is Calamity-touched land, and it remembers.

Fifty miles to Salsvault. Three to four days through one of the deadliest environments in Wildemount.

You take your first steps into the frozen wastes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Day 1 - Hidden Crevasse):

Around midday, the terrain changes. The solid ice gives way to a field of windswept snow—beautiful, pristine, deceptively smooth.

Then you hear it.

A soft creak. Like ice under pressure.

The snow beneath your feet feels... wrong.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Eiselcross interior, 50-mile trek from Syrinlya to Salsvault

**SITUATION**: Party must traverse one of the deadliest environments in Wildemount—frozen tundra with extreme temperatures, hidden crevasses, hostile wildlife, and Calamity-scarred magical hazards. This encounter covers 3-4 days of travel with survival challenges and potential combat.]]>

**TREK OVERVIEW**:

**Distance**: 50 miles northwest from Syrinlya
**Terrain**: Glacier fields, ice plains, frozen forests, rocky outcrops
**Duration**: 3-4 days (depending on pace and encounters)
**Temperature**: -20°F to -40°F (extreme cold)
**Conditions**: Variable weather, limited shelter, dangerous wildlife

**GUIDE ASSISTANCE**:

If party hired **Irven Liel** (from uid 2229):
• Party has advantage on group Survival checks
• Automatically avoids 1 random encounter (Irven knows safe route)
• Reduces travel time by 1 day (takes safest, fastest path)
• Provides warnings about territorial creatures

**Without guide**:
• Normal Survival checks
• All random encounters possible
• 4 days travel minimum
• Risk of getting lost

**DAILY STRUCTURE**:

Each day consists of:
• **Morning**: 4 hours travel
• **Midday**: Rest, eat, assess conditions
• **Afternoon**: 4 hours travel
• **Evening**: Make camp, rest, night watches

**EXTREME COLD RULES**:

**Characters without cold weather gear**:
• DC 10 CON save at end of each day or gain 1 level of exhaustion
• Disadvantage on all saves against cold

**Characters with cold weather gear**:
• Protected during normal conditions
• Still must save during magical storms or prolonged exposure (10+ hours)

**DAY 1: GLACIER FIELDS**:

**Terrain**: Vast expanse of wind-swept ice with hidden crevasses

**Challenge - Navigation**:
Group Survival DC 13 to maintain correct heading
• Success: Stay on course, make good progress
• Failure: Veer off course, add 1 day to journey

**Hazard - Hidden Crevasse**:

Around midday, party must cross field riddled with snow-covered crevasses.

**Each character makes DC 14 Perception check**:
• Success: Spots crevasse ahead, avoids
• Failure: Steps on false snow bridge

**If 2+ characters fail**:
False snow collapses. Falling characters must make DC 13 DEX save:
• Success: Catch edge, can pull self up with DC 12 Athletics
• Failure: Fall 40 feet into crevasse, take 4d6 bludgeoning damage, wedged in ice

**Rescue**: Requires rope (50 ft.) and DC 12 Athletics check. Takes 10 minutes per person.

**Cold Exposure in Crevasse**: Characters stuck for 10+ minutes must make DC 12 CON save or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

**Evening Camp - Day 1**:

Party must establish camp in harsh conditions.

**Group Survival DC 12**:
• Success: Find sheltered spot (rock outcrop), secure camp, good rest
• Failure: Exposed camp, disadvantage on watch Perception, restless sleep (no benefit from Hit Dice during short rest)

**Night Watch**:

**Passive Perception 13** (or active 15):
• Spot distant lights moving across ice—other expedition 2 miles away
• Hear haunting sounds carried on wind (could be wind, could be creatures)

**Random Encounter Roll** (1d6, on 1-2):
**2 Winter Wolves** approach camp, drawn by firelight. Initial distance 120 feet.

**Winter Wolf** stats:
• Large Monstrosity, Neutral Evil
• AC 13, HP 75, Speed 50 ft.
• STR 18 (+4), DEX 13 (+1), CON 14 (+2), INT 7 (-2), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 8 (-1)
• Skills: Perception +5, Stealth +3
• Damage Immunities: Cold
• Senses: Passive Perception 15
• Challenge: 3 (700 XP each)
• **Pack Tactics**: Advantage on attack if ally within 5 ft. of target
• **Snow Camouflage**: Advantage on Stealth in snowy terrain
• **Bite**: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage. If target is creature, DC 14 STR save or knocked prone.
• **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: 15-foot cone, DC 12 DEX save, 18 (4d8) cold damage, half on success

**Wolves' Tactics**:
• Approach stealthily (Stealth +3 with advantage = likely +5 or higher)
• Use terrain for cover
• Target weakest-looking prey (unarmored, small size)
• Use Cold Breath when 2+ targets clustered
• Fight to death (territorial predators)

**DAY 2: FROZEN FOREST**:

**Terrain**: Petrified forest—trees frozen solid by magical cold, twisted into unnatural shapes

**Atmosphere**: Eerie. Trees are crystalline sculptures. Perfect silence. Occasional cracking sounds as frozen branches break.

**Challenge - Magical Cold Zone**:

This area was hit directly by Calamity-era cold magic. Temperature drops to -50°F.

**All characters make DC 13 CON save**:
• Failure: Take 2d6 cold damage, speed halved for 1 hour
• Success: Take half damage, no speed reduction

**Potion of Cold Resistance** or similar protection grants advantage on save.

**Hazard - Frozen Awakened Trees**:

Some trees were awakened before the Calamity, then frozen mid-animation. Party's presence triggers partial reanimation.

**DC 15 Perception or Arcana**: Notice trees moving slightly, creaking ominously

If party doesn't avoid/retreat:

**1 Awakened Tree** (frozen variant) attacks:
• Large Plant, Unaligned
• AC 13 (ice-hardened bark), HP 59, Speed 20 ft.
• Vulnerability: Fire (double damage)
• Immunity: Cold
• **Slam**: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6+4) bludgeoning damage
• **Ice Limb** (special): When tree hits with slam, target makes DC 13 STR save or restrained by frozen branches (escape DC 13)
• Only fights until takes 30+ damage, then becomes dormant

**Alternative**: Party can avoid combat with DC 14 group Stealth to move through forest quietly without triggering trees.

**Evening Camp - Day 2**:

Party camps at edge of forest. Irven (if present) warns: "We're halfway. Tomorrow we enter yeti territory. Keep weapons ready."

**DAY 3: YETI TERRITORY**:

**Terrain**: Broken ice fields and rocky hills

**Challenge - Abominable Yeti**:

Around midday, party spots signs of large creature:
• Massive tracks (DC 10 Survival: "Abominable yeti. Old one, maybe 12 feet tall.")
• Bones of recent kill (reindeer, frozen solid)
• Territory marking (urine stains, claw marks on rocks)

**Group Stealth DC 15**:
• Success: Avoid yeti, proceed safely
• Failure: Yeti spots party, investigates

**If encountered**:

**Abominable Yeti** (CR 9—very dangerous, meant to be AVOIDED):
• Huge Monstrosity, Chaotic Evil
• AC 15, HP 137, Speed 40 ft., climb 40 ft.
• **Multiattack**: Two claw attacks
• **Claw**: +10 to hit, 14 (2d8+5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage
• **Cold Breath** (Recharge 6): 30-foot cone, DC 16 CON save, 45 (10d8) cold damage, half on success
• **Chilling Gaze**: Target within 30 ft. makes DC 14 CON save or takes 10 (3d6) cold damage, reduced to 0 HP = petrified in ice
• **Fear of Fire**: Takes double damage from fire, will retreat if takes 30+ fire damage in one turn

**TACTICAL RECOMMENDATION FOR DM**:

This encounter is designed to encourage creative problem-solving, not direct combat:
• Party can use fire to scare yeti away
• Can create distraction (dropped food, loud noise elsewhere)
• Can hide and wait for yeti to leave
• Can negotiate if someone speaks Giant (yeti is intelligent but territorial)
• Irven strongly advises: "Don't fight it. We run or we die."

**If party fights anyway**: Yeti focuses on largest threat, uses Chilling Gaze to petrify casters, retreats if reduced below 50 HP (will stalk party afterward).

**DAY 3-4: APPROACH TO SALSVAULT**:

**Terrain**: Rocky badlands with exposed Aeorian ruins

**Signs of Destination**:
• Ancient stone foundations emerging from ice
• Faint magical glow on horizon (purple-blue)
• Temperature increases slightly (arcane heating still functions)
• Ruins become more frequent and intact

**Challenge - Rival Expedition**:

**DC 13 Perception**: Spot signs of recent camp—ashes from fire (1 day old), tracks heading toward Salsvault

**DC 15 Investigation**: Tracks from 6-8 humanoids, well-equipped, disciplined formation (military or professional treasure hunters)

**Irven's Warning**: "Someone beat us here. Could be Myriad, Cerberus Assembly, or another group. Be careful—they might not be friendly."

**DM OPTION**: Foreshadow faction conflict. Party might find:
• Corpse of expedition member, frozen (killed by constructs or rivals)
• Hastily abandoned camp (fled from something)
• Hidden watchers observing Salsvault entrance

**ARRIVAL AT SALSVAULT**:

Late afternoon of Day 3 (with Irven) or Day 4 (without), party crests final ridge and sees destination:

"Below you, set into a glacier valley, lies Salsvault. The pre-Calamity facility is partially exposed—crystalline towers rise from the ice, glowing faintly with arcane energy. The main entrance is a massive door carved with Aeorian script, partially buried but accessible. Around the complex, you see other collapsed structures, broken glass, and the unmistakable signs of ancient destruction. The air thrums with residual magic."

**Irven's Farewell** (if hired):
"This is where I leave you. I'll make camp here and wait three days. If you're not back by then, I'm heading to Syrinlya. Good luck—you'll need it." *Hands party signal flare* "If you get in real trouble and make it outside, use this. I'll see it."

**XP REWARDS**:
• Successful navigation: 100 XP
• Surviving crevasse hazard: 50 XP
• Winter Wolves encounter (if occurred): 1400 XP (700 each)
• Awakened Tree encounter (avoided or defeated): 200 XP
• Avoiding Abominable Yeti: 300 XP (reward for smart play)
• Reaching Salsvault: 100 XP

**TIMING**: 30-45 minutes at table (represents 3-4 in-game days)

**PARTY CONDITION CHECK**:

Before entering Salsvault, party should:
• Have at least 50% HP
• Have available spell slots and abilities
• Have healing supplies
• Take short rest if needed (final preparation)

**TRANSITION TO UID 2231**:

Party approaches Salsvault entrance. The ancient doors are slightly ajar—someone (or something) has already opened them. Inside, darkness and the faint sound of mechanical humming.

The dungeon crawl begins.</text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Security Construct Activation):

The ceiling light globes flash from blue-white to red. An Aeorian voice—female, cold, clinical—echoes from the walls in a language you don't recognize, yet somehow understand:

"UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED. CONTAINMENT BREACH PROTOCOLS ACTIVE. DEPLOYING SECURITY UNIT. SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION."

A concealed alcove near the north door slides open with a hiss of escaping cold air. Frost cascades to the floor like a frozen waterfall.

From within emerges a humanoid figure of bronze metal and translucent blue glass. Its eyes glow with cold light. Internal mechanisms pulse with arcane energy visible through crystalline panels. Blade weapons extend from its forearms with a metallic shriek.

It turns its glowing eyes toward you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault Entrance Hall, near north door to Laboratory Wing

**SITUATION**: When the party enters Salsvault or spends 5 minutes exploring the entrance hall, the facility's ancient security system activates and deploys a preserved Aeorian Security Construct to eliminate the "unauthorized intruders."]]>

**ACTIVATION SEQUENCE**:

**Phase 1 - Warning** (1 round before combat):
Ceiling light globes flash from blue-white to red. An Aeorian voice (female, cold, clinical) echoes from walls in Ancient Common (comprehensible with Comprehend Languages spell):

> "UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED. CONTAINMENT BREACH PROTOCOLS ACTIVE. DEPLOYING SECURITY UNIT. SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION."

**Phase 2 - Deployment**:
A concealed alcove near the north door slides open with a hiss of escaping cold air. Frost cascades to floor. From within, an **Aeorian Security Construct** emerges—a humanoid figure of bronze metal and translucent blue glass, eyes glowing with cold light.

**AEORIAN SECURITY CONSTRUCT**:

**Appearance**: 6 feet tall, constructed from seamless bronze metal reinforced with transparent crystalline glass panels. Internal mechanisms visible through glass—glowing blue veins of arcane energy. Integrated blade weapons extend from forearms (3-foot retractable crystalline swords). Chest contains spherical power core pulsing with cold blue light.

**Starting Position**: Emerges from alcove 10 feet from north door, 30 feet from party's likely position.

**COMBAT TACTICS**:

**Round 1 - Threat Assessment**:
• Emerges from alcove with mechanical precision
• Scans party with glowing eyes (targeting protocols)
• Uses **Freeze Ray** on nearest spellcaster or ranged attacker
• Moves to block north door (defensive position protecting facility)

**Round 2+ - Eliminate Threats**:
• Focuses attacks on target dealing most damage to it
• Uses **Multiattack** when in melee range
• Recharges and uses **Freeze Ray** on targets attempting to bypass it or flee
• Intercepts anyone trying to access north door
• Fights until destroyed (no morale, no self-preservation instinct)

**SPECIAL BEHAVIORS**:

**Priority Targets**:
1. Creatures using fire-based attacks (registers as system threat)
2. Creatures attempting to access secured doors
3. Highest damage dealer
4. Nearest target if no priority threats identified

**Immune to Social Skills**: Cannot be intimidated, deceived, or persuaded. Construct follows programming: eliminate intruders.

**VULNERABILITIES**:

**Magic**:
• *Heat Metal* deals double damage (metal components)
• *Dispel Magic* can disable temporarily (DC 13 CON save or unconscious 1 minute)
• Vulnerable to antimagic fields (incapacitated)

**Thieves' Tools Hack**:
• DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools
• Requires 1 action while adjacent to construct
• Success: Construct disabled for 1 minute
• Failure by 5+: Construct immediately counterattacks

**ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES**:

**Reception Desk**: 
• Medium object, provides half cover (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
• Can be knocked over to create difficult terrain (DC 13 STR check)

**Floating Light Globes**:
• AC 12, 1 HP each
• If destroyed, explodes in 5-foot radius: DC 11 DEX save or take 2d4 cold damage
• Creates darkness in 20-foot radius where destroyed

**Frozen Floor**:
• If hit with fire or force damage, floor cracks
• Creature dealing damage must succeed DC 12 DEX save
• Failure: 10-foot radius becomes difficult terrain

**Alcove**:
• Concealed storage where construct was stationed
• Contains maintenance tools (investigation reveals)

**AFTERMATH**:

**Examining Defeated Construct** (DC 14 Arcana or Investigation):

Reveals:
• Powered by arcane battery still holding charge after 800 years
• **Salvageable Battery**: Worth 200 gp to artificers; can power Continual Flame for 1 year
• Internal mechanisms show advanced pre-Calamity design
• **Mechanical Insight**: Advantage on checks to understand other Aeorian technology in facility

**System Response** (after construct destroyed):

Aeorian voice: "SECURITY UNIT OFFLINE. INITIATING BACKUP PROTOCOLS. INTRUDERS WILL BE TERMINATED."

Red emergency lights dim to amber (warning level reduced but not eliminated).

**TREASURE**:

**From Construct**:
• Arcane battery (200 gp value)
• 2 crystalline blade fragments (50 gp each, can be crafted into dagger)

**From Desk Investigation** (DC 12):
• **Keycard** (rectangular crystal slate): Required to open secure doors deeper in facility
• Logbook showing expedition logs from 800 years ago
• 3 doses of universal antitoxin (functions as Potion of Vitality for disease)
• Medical instruments (100 gp value to collectors)

**XP REWARDS**:
• Aeorian Security Construct: 450 XP
• Discovering keycard: 50 XP
• Salvaging battery: 25 XP

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes (includes pre-combat warning and investigation)

**PARTY CHOICES AFTER COMBAT**:

Party can:
• **Proceed to North Door** (Laboratory Wing): Biohazard symbol, leads to active research labs
• **Proceed to East Door** (Research Chambers): Scroll symbol, leads to archives
• **Take Short Rest**: Entrance hall is secure after construct defeated

**DM NOTES**:

**Atmosphere**: The construct should feel alien and precise—not a mindless monster, but a sophisticated security system carrying out programmed directives. Its movements are smooth and mechanical, lacking any organic quality.

**Escalation**: The voice warning about "backup protocols" foreshadows more constructs deeper in the facility. Players should understand that stealth and caution matter here.

**Technology vs. Magic**: Emphasize that Aeorian technology surpasses modern Exandrian magic. The construct is 800 years old but functions perfectly—this should feel impressive and unsettling.

**First Dungeon Combat**: This encounter sets tone for Salsvault exploration: advanced technology, cold/hostile environment, mechanical precision. Players should feel like they're infiltrating an alien facility, not exploring a typical fantasy dungeon.

**TRANSITION**:

After defeating construct and investigating entrance hall, party must choose path into facility depths. Both Laboratory Wing and Research Chambers eventually converge at central Containment Vault where frigid woe cure awaits.</text>
</encounter>

<encounter><name>Salsvault - Entrance Hall</name><uid>2231</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You step through the ancient doors into a vast chamber. Sixty feet long, forty feet wide, with a vaulted ceiling reaching thirty feet above you. The walls are smooth glass-like material that glows faintly with blue-white light—Aeorian construction, impossibly preserved.

The air is cold but noticeably warmer than outside. Everything looks as if frozen in time 800 years ago—pristine, untouched, waiting.

Twenty feet ahead stands a reception desk carved from a single piece of crystal, covered in frost and dust. Floating light globes drift near the ceiling, their ancient magic still functioning after all this time.

The walls are carved with Pre-Calamity script and decorative patterns: DNA helixes, cells, biological diagrams.

Then you notice them.

Two frozen bodies in explorer gear lie near the north door. Recent. Dead only days. Blood frozen on the floor. Spent crossbow bolts scattered nearby.

Someone else was here. And something killed them.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault - Pre-Calamity Aeorian biological research facility, Entrance Hall

**SITUATION**: Party enters the ancient facility seeking the source of frigid woe and potential cure. The entrance has been breached recently (doors slightly ajar), and the facility's automated defenses are partially active. This encounter introduces the dungeon's dangers: magical traps, residual cold, and security constructs.]]>

**NOTABLE FEATURES**:

**FLOOR**: Seamless Aeorian glass-stone hybrid, slightly luminescent. Extremely durable (AC 20, immune to normal weapons).

**WALLS**: Carved with Pre-Calamity script and decorative patterns showing DNA helixes, cells, and biological diagrams.

**CEILING**: Arched, with floating light globes (magical, still functioning) providing bright light throughout chamber.

**RECEPTION DESK**: 20 feet from entrance, carved from single piece of crystal. Covered in frost and dust. Contains Aeorian documents (logs, entry records from 800+ years ago).

**PASSAGES**: 
• North door: Laboratory Wing (leads to uid 2232)
• East door: Research Chambers (leads to uid 2233)
• West alcove: Storage (contains supplies)
• South: Entrance (where party entered)

**CORPSES**: Two frozen bodies in explorer gear lie near north door—members of recent expedition. Dead 3-4 days (killed by construct).

**RECENT SIGNS**:
• Tracks in frost showing multiple people entered recently
• Broken seal on north door (someone forced it open)
• Spent crossbow bolts near corpses
• Blood frozen on floor

**HAZARD - RESIDUAL COLD MAGIC**:

The facility radiates unnatural cold. All creatures must make DC 11 CON save upon entering:
• Success: Acclimated, no effect
• Failure: Take 1d6 cold damage, disadvantage on first attack roll or ability check

**Characters with *Resist Cold* or similar**: Automatic success

**INVESTIGATION OPPORTUNITIES**:

**Reception Desk** (DC 12 Investigation):
• Aeorian logbook (partially readable with *Comprehend Languages* or DC 18 Intelligence (History))
• Last entry dated "15th of Duscar, 15 P.D." (Pre-Divergence—year before Calamity)
• Entry reads: "Biological containment protocols activated. Project Frigid Entropy shows promise as area denial weapon. Recommend immediate field testing. Security constructs programmed to prevent unauthorized access to central vault."
• Drawer contains **Keycard** (Aeorian glass rectangle with embedded rune circuit—required to access certain doors)

**Frozen Corpses** (DC 10 Medicine):
• Killed by precision strikes—construct weapons, not magic
• Identification papers show they were from Rexxentrum expedition (Cerberus Assembly)
• Carried supplies: 3 Potions of Healing (still usable), 50 gp, exploration tools

**Walls** (DC 15 Arcana):
• Script describes "biological stasis fields" and "disease preservation matrices"

• 5 vials of universal antitoxin (functions as *Potion of Vitality* for disease)
• Medical instruments (valuable to collectors, 100 gp set)
• Lab coats (no mechanical benefit, but stylish)
• Research notes on various diseases (academic value)

**ENCOUNTER - SECURITY CONSTRUCT**:

When party approaches north door (Laboratory Wing), or after 5 minutes of exploration, security system activates.

**WARNING**:
Ceiling light globes flash red. Aeorian voice (female, cold, clinical) echoes from walls in Ancient Common (comprehensible with *Comprehend Languages*):

"UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED. CONTAINMENT BREACH PROTOCOLS ACTIVE. DEPLOYING SECURITY UNIT. SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION."

From concealed alcove near north door, **Aeorian Security Construct** emerges.

**AEORIAN SECURITY CONSTRUCT** (Animated Armor variant, scaled to CR 2):

**False Appearance**: While motionless, indistinguishable from decorative alcove.

**Integrated Weapons**: Cannot be disarmed.

**ACTIONS**:

**Multiattack**: Two integrated blade attacks.

**Integrated Blade**: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Freeze Ray** (Recharge 5-6): Ranged energy attack, +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) cold damage, and target must succeed DC 13 CON save or have speed reduced to 0 until end of its next turn.

**CONSTRUCT TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: 
• Emerges from alcove
• Uses Freeze Ray on nearest caster or ranged attacker
• Moves to block north door (protects deeper facility)

**Round 2+**:
• Focuses on biggest threat (most damage dealt to it)
• Uses Multiattack when in melee
• Recharges and uses Freeze Ray on targets trying to bypass it
• Fights until destroyed (no morale, no surrender)

**TACTICAL NOTES FOR DM**:

• Construct is immune to social skills, intimidation, deception

**Floating Light Globes**: Can be shot down (AC 12, 1 HP each). Destroyed globe explodes with cold energy—5-foot radius, DC 11 DEX save, 2d4 cold damage. Creates darkness in 20-foot radius.

**AFTERMATH**:

After defeating construct:

**Examining Construct** (DC 14 Arcana or Investigation):
• Powered by small arcane battery (still holding charge after 800 years—testament to Aeorian engineering)
• Battery can be salvaged (worth 200 gp to artificers, can power *Continual Flame* for 1 year if repurposed)
• Internal mechanisms show remarkably advanced design (advantage on checks to understand other Aeorian technology in dungeon)

**System Response**:

Female voice: "SECURITY UNIT OFFLINE. INITIATING BACKUP PROTOCOLS. INTRUDERS WILL BE TERMINATED."

(Foreshadows more constructs deeper in facility)

**PARTY CHOICES**:

Party can now proceed to:
• **North Door** (Laboratory Wing, uid 2232): Marked with biohazard symbol, leads to active research labs
• **East Door** (Research Chambers, uid 2233): Marked with scroll symbol, leads to archives and specimen storage
• **Rest Here**: Safe room after construct defeated (short rest possible)

**XP REWARDS**:
• Aeorian Security Construct: 450 XP
• Discovering keycard: 50 XP
• Investigating corpses and desk: 25 XP
• Salvaging antitoxin vials: 25 XP

**TIMING**: 30-40 minutes (includes investigation and combat)

**DM NOTES**:

**Atmosphere**: Emphasize the alien, advanced technology. Aeorians were far beyond modern Exandrian magic. The facility is pristine, cold, and eerie—like stepping into a museum where exhibits might spring to life.

**Pacing**: This is the first dungeon encounter. Allow players to explore, read notes, and understand the facility's purpose. Build tension with environmental descriptions before construct activates.

**Foreshadowing**: The logbook and voice warnings hint at central vault (uid 2234-2235) as main objective. Create sense of delving deeper into increasingly dangerous areas.

**TRANSITION**:

After investigation and rest (if needed), party chooses path:
• Laboratory Wing (uid 2232): More constructs, active hazards
• Research Chambers (uid 2233): Lore, specimens, locked vault

Both paths eventually converge at Containment Vault (uid 2234).</text>
</encounter>

<encounter><name>Salsvault - Laboratory Wing</name><uid>2232</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The north door opens into a long corridor. Ten feet wide, stretching perhaps forty feet ahead. Floor-to-ceiling windows line both sides, providing clear views into laboratories beyond.

Emergency lighting casts everything in a red glow. The air is noticeably colder here—your breath mists in thick clouds.

Through the windows you can see:

To your left—examination tables, dissection tools, specimen jars filled with... things.

Straight ahead—glass containment cells. Some are cracked. Dark shapes move inside.

To your right—complex machinery, chemical vats, arcane apparatus pulsing with faint blue light.

Then the warning system activates.

Red lights flash. That same female Aeorian voice:

"WARNING: CONTAINMENT CELL SEVEN COMPROMISED. BIOLOGICAL HAZARD PRESENT. RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE EVACUATION."

You hear scratching sounds coming from the center laboratory.

The broken door swings open.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault Laboratory Wing - Active research labs where Aeorians conducted biological weapons experiments

**SITUATION**: Party enters the laboratory section where frigid woe and other diseases were developed and tested. This wing contains malfunctioning equipment, preserved test subjects, and more security constructs. Environmental hazards include containment breaches and arcane machinery gone unstable.

**LABORATORY WING LAYOUT**:

The north door from Entrance Hall opens into a corridor lined with observation windows. The corridor extends 40 feet before splitting into three laboratory chambers:
• **Lab A** (West): Specimen preparation and analysis
• **Lab B** (Center): Active containment cells
• **Lab C** (East): Synthesis and weaponization]]>

**CORRIDOR DESCRIPTION**:

The hallway is 10 feet wide with floor-to-ceiling windows looking into laboratories. Aeorian glass provides clear view into each room. Emergency lighting casts red glow (warning state). Air is noticeably colder here—10°F.

**Windows** show:
• Lab A: Examination tables, dissection tools, specimen jars
• Lab B: Glass containment cells (some cracked), shadowy figures inside
• Lab C: Complex machinery, chemical vats, arcane apparatus

**IMMEDIATE HAZARD - CONTAINMENT BREACH WARNING**:

As party proceeds down corridor, Aeorian warning system activates:

Red lights flash. Female voice: "WARNING: CONTAINMENT CELL SEVEN COMPROMISED. BIOLOGICAL HAZARD PRESENT. RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE EVACUATION."

**Perception DC 12**: Hear scratching sounds coming from Lab B (center)

**ENCOUNTER - ESCAPED TEST SUBJECTS**:

From Lab B, three preserved test subjects emerge through broken door. These were humans infected with experimental diseases 800 years ago, then frozen in magical stasis. The containment failure has awakened them, but the diseases have transformed them into undead-like creatures.

**3 FRIGID WRETCHES** (Zombie variant with cold theme):
• Medium Undead, Neutral Evil
• AC 10 (tattered clothing), HP 22 (3d8+9), Speed 20 ft.
• STR 13 (+1), DEX 6 (-2), CON 16 (+3), INT 3 (-4), WIS 6 (-2), CHA 5 (-3)
• Saving Throws: WIS +0
• Damage Immunities: Cold, Poison
• Condition Immunities: Poisoned, Exhausted
• Senses: Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 8
• Languages: Understands Ancient Common but can't speak
• Challenge: 1/2 (100 XP each)

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**:

**Undead Fortitude**: If damage reduces wretch to 0 HP, it makes CON save (DC = 5 + damage taken) unless damage is radiant or from critical hit. On success, drops to 1 HP instead.

**Ice-Preserved Flesh**: First time wretch takes damage each turn, attacker takes 1d4 cold damage (ice crystals shatter from impact).

**Infectious Touch**: Creatures hit by wretch's slam must succeed DC 11 CON save or contract frigid woe (stage 1: incubation 1d4 days).

**ACTIONS**:

**Slam**: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage, plus infectious touch.

**WRETCH TACTICS**:

• Wretches shamble toward nearest living creatures
• No strategy, pure instinct
• Attack whoever is closest
• Don't feel pain or fear
• Pursue until destroyed or targets escape
• Cannot open doors (INT too low)

**CORRIDOR COMBAT COMPLICATIONS**:

**Narrow Space**: 10-foot corridor becomes choke point. Maximum 2 Medium creatures can fight side-by-side.

**Slippery Floor**: Ice and frost make floor difficult terrain. Anyone moving more than half speed must succeed DC 10 DEX save or fall prone.

**Observation Windows**: AC 15, 10 HP each. Can be shattered to access labs, but might release more hazards.

**AFTER DEFEATING WRETCHES**:

Party can investigate three laboratories. Each requires opening door or breaking window.

**LAB A - SPECIMEN PREPARATION** (West):

**Contents**:
• Examination tables with ancient surgical tools (valuable to collectors, 50 gp)
• Preserved specimens in jars (various creatures, some humanoid)
• Aeorian microscope (masterwork, still functions, worth 200 gp)
• Research notes on disease vectors and transmission rates

**DC 14 Investigation**:
Find journal entry: "Day 47 of Project Frigid Entropy. Test subject 23 shows complete crystallization after 9 days. Speed of progression varies with Constitution scores—hardier subjects resist longer. Recommend refining viral payload to increase infection rate. Note: No cure has been synthesized. Stasis is only containment method."

**DC 16 Medicine**:
Recognize that notes include partial formula for frigid woe. With proper time and equipment, this could help synthesize cure—but faster route is finding the antidote vault.

**HAZARD - TOXIC FUMES**:

Breaking jars releases preserved chemicals. Any creature within 5 feet must succeed DC 12 CON save or take 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour.

**LAB B - CONTAINMENT CELLS** (Center):

**Contents**:
• 8 glass containment cells (3 broken, 5 intact)
• Broken cells are where wretches escaped
• Intact cells contain more frozen test subjects (stable, not hostile)

**Observation Panel** (requires Keycard from uid 2231):
Shows cell status:
• Cells 1-3: BREACH - Empty
• Cells 4-5: STABLE - Humanoid figures frozen
• Cell 6: STABLE - Large creature (possibly yeti)
• Cell 7: CRITICAL - Containment failing
• Cell 8: OFFLINE - Dark, indeterminate contents

**DC 13 Arcana**:
Panel can reinforce containment fields, preventing further breaches. Requires action and DC 15 Arcana check to operate controls.

**Success**: All cells stabilize, no additional creatures escape
**Failure**: Cell 7 ruptures in 1d4 rounds, releasing **Ice Mephit** (hostile, CR 1/2)

**TREASURE**:
In control console drawer:
• **Aeorian Data Crystal**: Contains complete research logs (valuable to Cobalt Soul, worth 500 gp, also provides lore about facility)
• Emergency healing vial (functions as *Potion of Greater Healing*)

**LAB C - SYNTHESIS AND WEAPONIZATION** (East):

**Contents**:
• Arcane apparatus for combining magical and biological agents
• Chemical vats (some empty, some containing frozen liquids)
• Weapon prototypes (crystalline grenades, spray devices)

**ACTIVE MACHINERY**:

Central apparatus is still running, powered by arcane core. It's synthesizing something—greenish liquid dripping into collection vial.

**DC 15 Arcana or Investigation**:
Machine is creating concentrated frigid woe disease vector. Collection vial contains enough to infect entire village. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

**Party Choices**:

**1. Destroy Machine** (DC 13 STR or appropriate tool):
• Stops production
• Vial shatters, releasing disease
• All creatures in room must succeed DC 13 CON save or contract frigid woe
• Safe option: No infectious material remains

**2. Carefully Extract Vial** (DC 15 DEX with Thieves' Tools or Medicine):
• Success: Obtain vial without exposure (could be used as weapon or study sample)
• Failure: Vial breaks, everyone saves as above

**3. Shut Down Safely** (DC 16 Arcana):
• Deactivate machine properly
• Extract vial safely
• Machine can be studied later
• Most technical solution

**TREASURE IN LAB C**:
• 3 **Crystalline Grenades** (Aeorian weapons): Function as *Alchemist's Fire* but deal cold damage instead, DC 12 DEX save, 2d6 cold damage
• Arcane battery (powers machine, worth 150 gp)
• Formulas for various biological weapons (dangerous knowledge, valuable to certain factions)

**ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD - CHEMICAL SPILL**:

If combat or actions cause vats to rupture:
• 10-foot radius around vat becomes hazardous
• Creatures entering or starting turn take 2d6 acid damage
• Area counts as difficult terrain
• Lasts until dispersed (requires 10 minutes ventilation or *Gust of Wind*)

**OPTIONAL ENCOUNTER - MALFUNCTIONING CONSTRUCT**:

If party is having easy time, add:

**Aeorian Lab Assistant** (Animated Armor variant, CR 1):
• Smaller construct designed for lab work
• Confused by 800-year shutdown, attacks intruders
• AC 16, HP 33, Speed 25 ft.
• **Integrated Toolarm**: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., 6 (1d6+3) slashing damage
• **Freezing Spray** (Recharge 5-6): 15-foot cone, DC 12 DEX save, 7 (2d6) cold damage

Construct emerges from Lab C when party investigates machinery.

**XP REWARDS**:
• 3 Frigid Wretches: 300 XP (100 XP each)
• Stabilizing containment cells: 100 XP
• Safely handling synthesis machine: 50 XP
• Lab Assistant (if encountered): 200 XP
• Discovering research data: 50 XP

**TIMING**: 30-45 minutes (includes combat and investigation)

**IMPORTANT LORE DISCOVERY**:

From research notes and data crystal, party learns:
• Frigid woe was designed as "area denial weapon"—make territory uninhabitable
• No cure was ever created—Aeorians relied on stasis fields to contain infected
• **CRITICAL INFO**: "Central Vault contains master control for all stasis fields and the Arcane Perpetuation Engine that maintains them. Any antidote or cure would be stored there, if it exists."
• Disease is airborne in gaseous form, touch-transmissible in liquid form
• Engine has been running for 800 years, slowly leaking disease into environment

**TRANSITION**:

After investigating labs, party can:
• Return to Entrance Hall
• Proceed to Research Chambers (uid 2233) via connecting door
• Advance toward Containment Vault (uid 2234) via secure passage (requires Keycard)

**Note**: If party collected data crystal and read notes, they now understand:
1. Central Vault is destination
2. Cure (if it exists) is there
3. Arcane Engine is source of ongoing contamination
4. Time is critical—engine leak may accelerate

**DM GUIDANCE**:

This encounter establishes:
• Aeorians were experimenting with horrific weapons
• Facility is dangerous even 800 years later
• Cure exists in Containment Vault (provides clear objective)
• Party is racing against time (disease spreading)

Create tension but provide clear path forward.</text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The east door opens into a magnificent domed chamber, fifty feet across. The ceiling soars twenty-five feet above, covered in an elaborate fresco showing Aeorian society before the Calamity—floating cities, magical wonders, thriving civilization.

Beautiful. Haunting.

The walls glow with soft blue light. Five alcoves ring the perimeter: archives, specimen vaults, storage rooms, a personal office.

At the center stands a pedestal holding what appears to be a holographic display. Arcane circuitry pulses faintly within the crystalline surface, waiting to be activated.

This was a place of knowledge. Of research. Of ambition that reached too far.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault Research Chambers - Archives, specimen storage, and historical records

**SITUATION**: Party explores the research wing where Aeorians stored their experimental data, preserved specimens, and historical documentation. This area is quieter than Laboratory Wing but contains valuable lore, magical traps protecting sensitive information, and evidence of the facility's true purpose.

**RESEARCH CHAMBERS LAYOUT**:

The east door from Entrance Hall opens into a large circular chamber 50 feet in diameter with 25-foot domed ceiling. The room serves as central hub with five alcoves radiating outward:

• **North Alcove**: Archives (data storage)
• **Northeast Alcove**: Specimen Vault (preserved creatures)
• **Southeast Alcove**: Historical Records (Pre-Calamity documentation)
• **Southwest Alcove**: Lead Researcher's Office (personal workspace)
• **Northwest Alcove**: Secure Storage (magical items and artifacts)]]>

The dome ceiling features elaborate fresco showing Aeorian society before the Calamity—floating cities, magical wonders, thriving civilization. Beautiful but haunting given city's fate.

**Central Pedestal**: Holds holographic display (still functioning) showing facility layout and status. Requires Keycard to activate fully.

**Lighting**: Dim blue glow from walls (arcane phosphorescence)

**Office Contents**:
• Desk with journal, notes, personal effects
• Small bookshelf with technical manuals
• Comfortable chair (frozen but intact)
• Portrait of woman (presumably Vess, wearing research robes)

**Vess's Journal** (DC 10 Investigation to find, readable):

Key entries:
• "Day 120: Success! Frigid Entropy shows 100% infection rate in test subjects. Military is pleased."
• "Day 135: Command wants to know about antidote. Created universal cure and stored in Vault. Better safe than sorry."
• "Day 140: Troubling reports from main city. They're actually building the Factorum Malleus—the god-killer. This will end badly."
• "Day 142: Last entry. City leadership has gone mad with power. I fear the gods will respond. If anyone finds this, know that we meant to protect mortals, not doom them. Antidote is in Locker 7. Code: 3-8-15. May the gods forgive us."

**Authorization Code Found**: 3-8-15 (needed for uid 2234)

**Personal Effects**:
• Silver locket with family portrait (emotional moment, humanizes Aeorians)
• Research badge (grants advantage on next Arcana check related to facility)
• 50 gp in Aeorian currency (collector's items, worth face value in metal)

**NORTHWEST ALCOVE - SECURE STORAGE**:

Locked chamber requiring Keycard to access.

**Warning Sign**: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. DANGEROUS ARTIFACTS."

**Interior**:
Small vault with reinforced walls, magical wards (inactive), item pedestals.

**Treasure**:
• **+1 Wand of Magic Missiles** (Aeorian design, crystalline)
• **Ring of Cold Resistance** (essential for Eiselcross survival)
• 3 **Potions of Greater Healing**
• **Aeorian Emergency Kit**: Contains tools, rations, magical light source (worth 100 gp)

**MAGICAL TRAP - WARD OF BINDING**:

If someone attempts to take items without deactivating ward:
• DC 15 Arcana to detect ward
• DC 16 Thieves' Tools or Arcana to disarm

**If triggered**:
All creatures in alcove must make DC 14 WIS save or be paralyzed for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of each turn).

**CENTERPIECE ENCOUNTER - RIVAL EXPEDITION**:

When party has explored 3+ alcoves, they encounter survivors of rival expedition mentioned in uid 2231.

**3 Cerberus Assembly Agents** emerge from Northwest Alcove (they've been looting):

**Cerberus Agent** (Scout variant, each):
• Medium Humanoid (Human), Lawful Neutral
• AC 13 (leather armor), HP 20 (3d8+6), Speed 30 ft.
• Skills: Stealth +5, Perception +4
• **Shortsword**: +5 to hit, 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage
• **Light Crossbow**: +5 to hit, 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage
• Challenge: 1 (200 XP each)

**Leader - Agent Kellan** (Mage, CR 6 - dangerous):
• Medium Humanoid (Human), Lawful Evil
• AC 12 (15 with *Mage Armor*), HP 40 (9d8), Speed 30 ft.
• **Spellcaster**: 9th-level, INT-based, spell save DC 14, +6 to hit
• Spells: *Shield*, *Burning Hands*, *Misty Step*, *Hold Person*, *Fireball*, *Counterspell*
• Challenge: 6 (2,300 XP)

**Initial Reaction**:

Kellan raises hand: "Stop! We're not enemies. We're from Rexxentrum, sanctioned by the Cerberus Assembly. You must be the group from Palebank. Interesting that we both arrived at the same conclusion."

**Negotiation Opportunity**:

Kellan is pragmatic, not needlessly hostile:

**DC 12 Persuasion or Insight**:
• He's desperate—lost half his team to constructs
• Wants to find cure and return to Rexxentrum
• Willing to cooperate if it means survival
• Will share information about facility defenses

**Party Choices**:

**1. Cooperate**: 
• Kellan shares what he knows about Containment Vault access
• Offers temporary alliance to reach Engine Room
• Will want partial credit for cure (political complications)
• Peaceful resolution, bonus XP

**2. Refuse but Don't Fight**:
• Kellan warns: "Don't interfere with Assembly business"
• Tense standoff, but no combat
• Race to Containment Vault (who gets there first)

**3. Attack**:
• Combat ensues (difficult fight, Kellan is CR 6)
• Surviving agents flee after Kellan falls
• Party gains loot but makes powerful enemy (Cerberus Assembly)

**DM GUIDANCE**: Encourage cooperation. This creates moral complexity—party succeeds but Assembly also benefits. Alternatively, clever party might race ahead and lock agents out.

**COMBAT TACTICS** (if fight occurs):

**Round 1**:
• Kellan casts *Mage Armor* (if not active), falls back behind agents
• Agents draw crossbows, take cover behind pedestals (half cover)

**Round 2+**:
• Kellan casts *Fireball* if party clustered (careful to avoid agents)
• Uses *Shield* to defend against attacks
• *Counterspell* against party spellcasters
• Agents focus fire on party spellcasters, then switch to melee

**Morale**: 
• Agents flee if Kellan dies
• Kellan surrenders if reduced to 10 HP or less

**XP REWARDS**:
• Grick: 450 XP
• Peaceful resolution with Kellan: 600 XP (bonus for diplomacy)
• Combat victory: 2,900 XP (Kellan 2,300 + 3 agents 600)
• Discovering authorization code: 100 XP
• Recovering artifacts: 50 XP
• Thorough research: 50 XP

**TIMING**: 40-60 minutes (includes exploration, combat, and negotiation)

**TRANSITION TO UID 2234**:

With authorization code (3-8-15) and understanding of facility purpose, party proceeds to Containment Vault.

**If cooperating with Kellan**: He accompanies party, provides magical support
**If enemies**: Race against time before he reaches Vault first
**If he fled/died**: Party has clear path

**Key Information Gained**:
1. Antidote exists in Locker 7
2. Authorization code: 3-8-15
3. Arcane Engine is source of contamination
4. Must decide what to do about Engine (disable? exploit? destroy?)
5. Consequences of choices will affect Palebank and possibly wider world

Path leads to secure corridor connecting Research Chambers to Containment Vault.</text>

<encounter><name>Salsvault - Containment Vault</name><uid>2234</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching the Vault):

The secure corridor stretches forty feet ahead, its reinforced walls covered in glowing runes and warning signs. Red emergency lighting creates ominous shadows.

You can make out the Aeorian script even without magic:

"AUTHORIZED LEVEL 5 PERSONNEL ONLY"
"BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS ACTIVE"
"UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION"

At the end of the corridor stands a massive door—ten feet tall, covered in circuits and glowing runes. Ancient. Powerful. Waiting.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering the Vault):

The door opens with a soft hiss. The air inside is different—warmer, controlled. Fifty degrees Fahrenheit. The warmest place you've experienced since entering this frozen hell.

The chamber is circular, forty feet across, with a twenty-foot ceiling. Pristine. Preserved. Waiting for 800 years.

At the center stands a large crystalline pedestal—empty now, whatever it held long gone.

Around the perimeter, twelve secure storage lockers numbered 1 through 12. Each sealed behind a glowing blue containment field.

Locker 7.

That's what the journal said. Locker 7.

The cure is here. You can feel it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault Containment Vault - Secure storage for dangerous biological materials and antidotes

**SITUATION**: Party reaches the vault where the frigid woe antidote is stored. This is the primary objective of the adventure. However, accessing the cure requires solving security puzzles, and the vault's guardian construct remains active. Success here means saving Palebank Village.]]>

**SECURE CORRIDOR**:

From Research Chambers, party proceeds down 40-foot hallway with reinforced walls. Red emergency lighting creates ominous atmosphere.

**Warning Signs** (in Aeorian script, readable with *Comprehend Languages*):
"AUTHORIZED LEVEL 5 PERSONNEL ONLY"
"BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS ACTIVE"
"UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION"

**Security Door**: Massive Aeorian metal door, 10 feet tall, covered in runes and glowing circuits.

**DOOR MECHANISM**:

Control panel features three elements:
1. **Keycard Slot** (requires Keycard from uid 2231)
2. **Authorization Code Input** (requires 3-8-15 from uid 2233)
3. **Biometric Scanner** (ancient, non-functional—can be bypassed)

**Accessing Door**:

**Option 1 - Proper Access**: Insert Keycard + Enter Code (3-8-15)
• Door unlocks smoothly
• No alarms
• Clean entry

**Option 2 - Force Entry**: DC 20 STR check or deal 100 damage to door (AC 19)
• Success: Door breaches
• Triggers alarm—vault guardian activates immediately (no exploration time)
• Loud noise might alert any rivals (Kellan's group if still active)

**Option 3 - Hack Door**: DC 18 Thieves' Tools + Arcana check
• Success: Bypass security
• Takes 10 minutes
• 50% chance of triggering alarm (roll 1d20, on 10 or lower alarm activates)

**CONTAINMENT VAULT DESCRIPTION**:

The door opens into a circular chamber 40 feet in diameter with 20-foot ceiling. The room is pristine, temperature-controlled (comfortable 50°F—warmest place in facility).

**Vault Features**:

**Central Pedestal**: Large crystalline platform in room center, currently empty (something was stored there, now missing).

**Wall Lockers**: 12 secure storage lockers numbered 1-12, arranged around perimeter. Each has individual lock and containment field (glowing blue energy).

**Locker 7** (mentioned in Vess's journal): Contains antidote

**Other Lockers**: Contain various biological samples, some dangerous

**Ceiling**: Reinforced, with suspended guardian construct in alcove (activates when intruders detected)

**Lighting**: Bright white illumination (diagnostic lighting for lab work)

**LOCKER INVESTIGATION**:

Party can investigate lockers. Each requires:
• **Keycard** to deactivate containment field
• **Authorization Code** (3-8-15) OR DC 15 Thieves' Tools to unlock
• Specific lockers contain:

**Locker 1-5**: Various disease samples (dangerous if mishandled)
**Locker 6**: Empty (contents removed long ago)
**Locker 7**: **FRIGID WOE ANTIDOTE** (quest objective!)
**Locker 8-10**: Pre-Calamity medical supplies (healing potions, antitoxins)
**Locker 11**: Experimental mutagen (unstable, could grant temporary benefits or harm)
**Locker 12**: Biological weapon prototype (extremely dangerous)

**LOCKER 7 - THE ANTIDOTE**:

Opening Locker 7 reveals:

**Crystal Case** containing 6 vials of iridescent blue liquid. Each vial is labeled in Aeorian script: "Project Frigid Entropy - Universal Cure. Dosage: One vial per infected individual. Administer orally or intravenously. Reverses all stages of infection within 1d4 hours."

**Success!** Party has found cure for frigid woe. Enough vials for:
• Tulgi Lutan (if still alive and party chooses to save her)
• Hulil Lutan (if still alive and party chooses to save her)
• Any infected villagers in Palebank
• 1-2 vials remaining for emergencies or study

**Additional Contents of Locker 7**:
• Research notes on antidote synthesis
• Formula (could be used to create more, but requires advanced lab)
• Vess Aranon's personal note: "If you're reading this, the worst has happened. Use this wisely. Don't let our mistakes be in vain."

**ENCOUNTER - VAULT GUARDIAN**:

When party accesses Locker 7 (or if alarm was triggered), vault guardian activates.

**AEORIAN VAULT GUARDIAN** (Helmed Horror variant, CR 4):
• Medium Construct, Unaligned
• AC 20 (reinforced plating), HP 75 (10d8+30), Speed 30 ft., fly 30 ft.
• STR 18 (+4), DEX 13 (+1), CON 16 (+3), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 10 (+0)
• Skills: Perception +4
• Damage Resistances: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from nonmagical attacks
• Damage Immunities: Cold, Force, Poison
• Condition Immunities: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Stunned
• Senses: Blindsight 60 ft., Passive Perception 14
• Challenge: 4 (1,100 XP)

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**:

**Magic Resistance**: Advantage on saves against spells and magical effects.

**Spell Immunity**: Immune to three specific spells (DM choice, recommend: *Hold Person*, *Lightning Bolt*, *Heat Metal*).

**Integrated Arsenal**: Cannot be disarmed, weapons are part of its body.

**ACTIONS**:

**Multiattack**: Two longsword attacks.

**Longsword**: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10+4) if used with two hands.

**Freeze Beam** (Recharge 5-6): Ranged spell attack, +6 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and target must succeed DC 14 CON save or be restrained by ice (escape DC 14 STR check, ice has AC 15 and 10 HP).

**GUARDIAN'S OPENING STATEMENT**:

When activated, guardian's eyes glow blue-white. Aeorian voice (male, authoritative):

"UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO RESTRICTED BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS. INITIATING TERMINATION PROTOCOL. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO SURRENDER AND SUBMIT FOR QUARANTINE."

**Party Choices**:

**1. Fight**: Standard combat encounter

**2. Surrender**: Guardian attempts to place party in stasis chambers (escape DC 15 STR, can fight way out after)

**3. Deactivate** (DC 18 Arcana or DC 20 Thieves' Tools):
• Requires access to guardian's control port (reach 5 ft., must succeed melee touch attack vs. AC 20)
• Takes 1 action to attempt deactivation
• Success: Guardian powers down permanently
• Failure: Guardian gets opportunity attack

**4. Reason With It** (DC 16 Persuasion or Deception):
• Claim to be authorized Level 5 personnel conducting emergency retrieval
• Show Keycard and authorization code as "proof"
• Success: Guardian stands down, allows party to leave with antidote
• Failure: Guardian attacks, no second chance

**GUARDIAN TACTICS**:

**Round 1**:
• Flies to blocking position between party and exit
• Uses Freeze Beam on character holding antidote vials
• Declares: "RETURN BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS TO CONTAINMENT"

**Round 2+**:
• Focuses attacks on whoever has the antidote
• Uses Multiattack when in melee range
• Attempts to grapple character with vials (Athletics +7)
• If successful grapple, tries to force vials back into locker
• Fights to destruction (no morale)

**ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**:

**Containment Fields**: Active fields around lockers create hazardous zones. Creature entering within 5 feet of active locker takes 2d6 force damage (DC 13 DEX save for half).

**Central Pedestal**: Can be used as cover (half cover, +2 AC/DEX saves). AC 19, 40 HP.

**Lockers**: AC 18, 25 HP each. Destroying locker releases contents (potentially disease samples—risky!).

**VICTORY**:

After defeating/bypassing guardian, party has secured the antidote!

**Immediate Decisions**:

1. **Take all vials or leave some**? (Ethical question about hoarding cure vs. making it available)

2. **Investigate other lockers**? (Risk vs. reward—more treasure but potential danger)

3. **Proceed to Engine Room** (uid 2235)? (Optional objective—stop source of contamination)

**OTHER LOCKER CONTENTS**:

If party investigates further:

**Locker 8**: 4 Potions of Greater Healing
**Locker 9**: 3 vials of universal antitoxin (rare, valuable)
**Locker 10**: Medical kit (advantage on Medicine checks, 10 uses)

**Locker 11 - Experimental Mutagen**:
• Red crystalline liquid
• If consumed: DC 15 CON save
• Success: Gain +2 STR and advantage on CON saves for 1 hour
• Failure: Take 4d6 poison damage and poisoned for 1 hour
• High risk, high reward

**Locker 12 - Biological Weapon**:
• Sealed canister marked "PROJECT DARK WINTER"
• Contains airborne plague (much worse than frigid woe)
• **DO NOT OPEN** (DM warning: TPK-level danger if mishandled)
• Could be sold to nefarious factions for enormous sum (moral choice)
• Kobalt Soul would demand its destruction

**XP REWARDS**:
• Securing antidote: 500 XP (major objective)
• Vault Guardian: 1,100 XP
• Peaceful resolution with guardian: +200 XP bonus
• Investigating all lockers safely: 100 XP

**TIMING**: 30-45 minutes

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT**:

Party now has the cure. They can:

**Option A**: Leave immediately, return to Palebank, distribute cure, save lives
• Safe choice
• Engine continues running (frigid woe may resurface elsewhere)
• Quick resolution

**Option B**: Proceed to Engine Room (uid 2235), attempt to shut down source
• Heroic choice
• Risks delay (people in Palebank worsen)
• Could permanently solve problem
• More dangerous

**NPC ADVICE** (if Kellan is present):

"We have what we came for. The Assembly will want this cure immediately. Stopping the Engine is... admirable, but risky. People are dying *now*."

**PARTY VOTE**: Let players discuss and decide. Both choices are valid, have consequences.

**TRANSITION**:

If proceeding to Engine Room: Secure door at back of vault leads to final area (uid 2235).

If returning to surface: Party must retrace steps through facility (can skip detailed description, montage of exiting).

**TREASURE SUMMARY**:
• 6 vials frigid woe antidote (priceless)
• 4 Potions of Greater Healing (worth 600 gp total)
• 3 universal antitoxins (worth 450 gp total)
• Medical kit (worth 50 gp)
• Experimental mutagen (worth 200 gp to right buyer)
• Biological weapon canister (worth 5,000+ gp to criminals, moral hazard)

**DM NOTE**: Emphasize weight of responsibility. Party holds lives in their hands (antidote) and potentially world-altering weapon (Project Dark Winter). Choices matter.</text>

**Option C - Hybrid**:
Use condensed encounters but add specific rooms as needed:
• S4+S5: Flame lever puzzle
• S10: Ferol's note and treasure
• S13: Drowned library octopus
• S17: Ferol Sal negotiation
• S18: Final cure retrieval

**DM CHOICE**: Adjust based on party preferences, time available, and narrative pacing needs.]]></text>

<encounter><name>Salsvault - Arcane Perpetuation Engine</name><uid>2235</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Descending to the Engine Room):

Beyond the vault, a secure door opens to reveal descending stairs carved from ice-bonded stone. The temperature drops immediately—back to the biting cold. Minus ten degrees.

But there's something else now. A hum. Low, resonant, growing louder with each step down.

The walls are covered in glowing runes—Aeorian power conduits pulsing with energy. Emergency lighting flickers. Power fluctuations.

Fifty feet down.

At the bottom, a warning sign:

"CRITICAL SYSTEMS—AUTHORIZED ENGINEERS ONLY. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IMMINENT IF DAMAGED."

The hum has become a roar.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering the Engine Room):

The chamber is massive. Eighty feet across, forty-foot domed ceiling. And at its center...

The Arcane Perpetuation Engine.

Thirty feet tall, anchored to floor and ceiling. A towering construct of crystalline metal, glowing conduits, rotating rings, and pulsing energy cores. Tubes contain preserved tissue samples suspended in glowing fluid. Energy arcs between nodes. The whole structure pulses like a heartbeat.

Beautiful. Terrifying. Alien.

And it's leaking.

Green-tinted energy seeps from cracks in the structure, dissipating into the air like toxic mist. Frigid woe. The source. Still active after 800 years, still spreading disease into the frozen wastes.

Around the perimeter, six crystalline pillars channel energy from the engine. Glass tanks along the walls contain figures—test subjects from before the Calamity, still alive in magical suspension.

A control console glows softly to the north.

And on the south wall, a large red lever marked with warning symbols:

"EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN—CATASTROPHIC SYSTEMS FAILURE RISK."

This is it. The heart of Salsvault.

What do you do?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Salsvault Central Engine Room - Heart of the facility, source of frigid woe contamination

**SITUATION**: Party reaches the Arcane Perpetuation Engine, a pre-Calamity marvel that has been running continuously for 800 years, maintaining biological stasis fields and inadvertently leaking frigid woe into environment. This encounter is OPTIONAL—party already has cure and could leave. Proceeding here is heroic choice to stop source permanently.

**WARNING**: This is the most dangerous encounter in the adventure. Party should be at full strength.]]>

**ENGINE ROOM ACCESS**:

From Containment Vault, secure door (requires Keycard) leads to descending stairs. Temperature drops dramatically—back to -10°F. Magical energy hums audibly, growing louder with each step down.

**Stairway Features**:
• 50-foot descent
• Carved from solid ice-bonded stone
• Walls covered in glowing runes (Aeorian power conduits)
• Emergency lighting flickers (power fluctuations)

**Warning Sign** (at bottom of stairs): "CRITICAL SYSTEMS—AUTHORIZED ENGINEERS ONLY. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IMMINENT IF DAMAGED."

**ENGINE ROOM DESCRIPTION**:

The stairs open into a massive chamber 80 feet in diameter with 40-foot domed ceiling. This is the facility's power core and control center.

**THE ENGINE**:

At room's center rises the Arcane Perpetuation Engine—a towering construct of crystalline metal, glowing conduits, rotating rings, and pulsing energy cores. It stands 30 feet tall, anchored to floor and ceiling.

**Visual Description**: Imagine a fusion of magical reactor and biological life-support system. Tubes contain preserved tissue samples suspended in glowing fluid. Energy arcs between nodes. The whole structure pulses like a heartbeat. Beautiful, terrifying, alien.

**Current State**: Engine is functional but degraded. 800 years of continuous operation without maintenance have created instabilities. Green-tinted energy leaks from cracks—this is frigid woe dispersing into the environment.

**Room Features**:

**Control Console** (North): Aeorian command station with holographic displays showing facility status. Requires Keycard and DC 16 Arcana to operate.

**Power Conduits** (Around perimeter): Six crystalline pillars channel energy from engine to facility systems. Each pillar glows blue-white and hums with power.

**Stasis Chambers** (East/West walls): Glass tanks containing preserved biological specimens—test subjects from 800 years ago, still alive in magical suspension.

**Emergency Shutdown Lever** (South): Large red lever marked with warning symbols. Clearly labeled "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN—CATASTROPHIC SYSTEMS FAILURE RISK."

**Observation Platforms**: Raised walkways 10 feet above main floor, providing elevated positions.

**ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS**:

**Ambient Radiation**: Magical energy saturation. All creatures make DC 12 CON save upon entering or take 2d6 force damage. Repeat save every 10 minutes.

**Frigid Woe Leaks**: Green mist vents from engine cracks. Creatures within 10 feet of engine must succeed DC 13 CON save each round or contract frigid woe (stage 1).

**Unstable Conduits**: If power conduit is damaged (AC 15, 30 HP), it explodes in 15-foot radius. DC 14 DEX save, 4d6 lightning damage, half on success.

**INVESTIGATION OPPORTUNITIES**:

**Control Console** (DC 16 Arcana, 10 minutes):

Reveals three options for dealing with engine:

**OPTION 1: EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN**
• Pull emergency lever
• Engine powers down immediately
• All stasis fields collapse (specimens die/released)
• Facility becomes inert (no more leaks)
• **RISK**: Engine might explode (10% chance, 10d6 force damage to all in room, DC 15 DEX save for half)
• **OUTCOME**: Clean solution, minimal risk

**OPTION 2: CONTROLLED SHUTDOWN**
• Use control console to gradually power down engine
• Requires DC 18 Arcana check and 3 rounds of concentration
• Preserves specimens, prevents explosion
• **RISK**: Leaves party vulnerable during shutdown sequence
• **OUTCOME**: Ideal solution if successful

**OPTION 3: REPURPOSE ENGINE**
• Reprogram engine to different function (no longer produces frigid woe)
• Requires DC 20 Arcana check and understanding of Aeorian engineering
• Could provide ongoing benefit (power source for Palebank or Uthodurnian outpost)
• **RISK**: Very difficult, might malfunction catastrophically
• **OUTCOME**: Most ambitious solution, potentially valuable

**OPTION 4: LEAVE IT RUNNING**
• Do nothing, exit with antidote
• Engine continues leaking disease
• Problem will worsen over time
• **OUTCOME**: Selfish but safest for party

**ENGINE GUARDIAN ENCOUNTER**:

If party interacts with console or approaches engine, final guardian activates.

**AEORIAN ENGINE WARDEN** (Custom, CR 5):
• Large Construct, Lawful Neutral
• AC 18 (integrated armor plating), HP 95 (10d10+40), Speed 30 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover)
• STR 20 (+5), DEX 14 (+2), CON 18 (+4), INT 12 (+1), WIS 14 (+2), CHA 10 (+0)
• Saving Throws: CON +7, WIS +5
• Damage Resistances: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from nonmagical attacks
• Damage Immunities: Cold, Lightning, Poison, Psychic
• Condition Immunities: Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned
• Senses: Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 12
• Languages: Understands Common and Aeorian but doesn't speak
• Challenge: 5 (1,800 XP)

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**:

**Magic Resistance**: Advantage on saves against spells and magical effects.

**Power Link**: While within 30 feet of engine, warden regains 10 HP at start of its turn if it has at least 1 HP.

**Immutable Form**: Immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Overload Pulse** (Recharge 5-6): When warden takes 20+ damage from single source, releases pulse of energy. All creatures within 20 feet make DC 15 CON save or take 3d8 lightning damage and be stunned until end of warden's next turn.

**ACTIONS**:

**Multiattack**: Three attacks—two with integrated blade, one with force cannon.

**Integrated Blade**: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

**Force Cannon**: Ranged spell attack, +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d8) force damage.

**Restraining Field** (Recharge 5-6): Target one creature within 60 feet. Target must succeed DC 15 STR save or be restrained by bands of force for 1 minute. Restrained creature can repeat save at end of each turn, ending effect on success. Field has AC 18 and 25 HP; destroying it frees creature.

**LEGENDARY ACTIONS** (3 per round, end of another creature's turn):

**Move**: Warden flies up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Blade Attack** (Costs 1): Make one integrated blade attack.

**Energy Beam** (Costs 2): Release 60-foot line of energy. Each creature in line makes DC 15 DEX save or takes 10 (3d6) force damage.

**WARDEN'S OPENING STATEMENT**:

Eyes glow bright blue. Aeorian voice (deep, mechanical):

"FINAL WARNING. STEP AWAY FROM ARCANE PERPETUATION ENGINE. UNAUTHORIZED INTERFERENCE WITH CRITICAL SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE LETHAL FORCE. THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO RETREAT."

**Party Responses**:

**1. Retreat**: Warden allows party to leave (can return to Entrance Hall safely)

**2. Negotiate** (DC 17 Persuasion or Deception):
• "We're here to repair the engine, not destroy it!"
• Must show technical knowledge (Arcana check to sound convincing)
• Success: Warden grants 3 rounds to "repair" (time to attempt controlled shutdown)
• Failure: Warden attacks

**3. Attack**: Combat begins

**4. Distract** (DC 15 Deception or Performance):
• One character creates distraction while others work on console
• Success: Warden focuses on distraction, others gain 2 rounds free action
• Clever strategy for coordinated party

**WARDEN COMBAT TACTICS**:

**Round 1**:
• Flies to position between party and engine (protects it)
• Uses Restraining Field on character closest to console
• Declares: "CEASE IMMEDIATELY OR BE TERMINATED"

**Round 2**:
• Multiattack on biggest threat (highest damage dealer or spellcaster)
• Uses Overload Pulse if took significant damage
• Positions to maximize Energy Beam legendary action

**Round 3+**:
• Focuses fire on anyone tampering with engine or console
• Uses Power Link to heal (stay near engine)
• Prioritizes killing threats over spreading damage
• No mercy, no morale—fights to destruction

**If party attempts shutdown during combat**:
• Warden recognizes threat, uses all actions to interrupt
• Uses Restraining Field on console operator
• "CRITICAL SYSTEMS SHUTDOWN UNAUTHORIZED—TERMINATING THREAT"

**ENVIRONMENTAL COMBAT DYNAMICS**:

**Power Conduits**: Party can destroy conduits to damage warden indirectly (conduit explosion damages all nearby, including warden)

**Observation Platforms**: Elevated positions provide cover and line-of-sight advantages

**Stasis Chambers**: Can be shattered (AC 12, 15 HP) to release ancient specimens (unpredictable—might attack everyone, might flee, might be harmless)

**Engine Itself**: AC 20, HP 150, damage resistance all types. Party can attempt to damage engine directly, but warden will prioritize stopping this.

**CONTROLLED SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE** (if attempted during combat):

**Requires**: Character at console, 3 consecutive rounds of concentration

**DC 18 Arcana checks** (one per round):
• Round 1: Initialize shutdown sequence (success: begin, failure: restart count)
• Round 2: Reroute power conduits (success: continue, failure: restart count)
• Round 3: Finalize shutdown (success: engine powers down, failure: must start over)

**During procedure**:
• Character at console cannot take other actions (Dodge action allowed)
• If character takes damage, makes DC 10 + damage dealt CON save or loses concentration
• Other party members must protect console operator from warden

**SUCCESS**: Engine powers down safely. Green leaks stop. Warden deactivates (no longer has power source). Room becomes safe.

**EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN** (quick option):

**Any character can pull emergency lever** as action.

**Immediate effects**:
• Roll 1d10
• 1: Catastrophic explosion—10d6 force damage to all in room, DC 15 DEX save half
• 2-10: Clean shutdown—engine powers down, warden deactivates, room safe

**Fast but risky option for desperate parties.**

**VICTORY CONDITIONS**:

**Option A**: Defeat warden in combat, then shutdown engine at leisure

**Option B**: Successfully complete controlled shutdown during combat (warden deactivates when engine powers down)

**Option C**: Use emergency shutdown and survive any explosion

**Option D**: Repurpose engine (DC 20 Arcana, same concentration procedure as controlled shutdown)

**AFTERMATH**:

**If engine shut down**:
• Frigid woe leaks cease immediately
• Salsvault becomes inert (no longer dangerous)
• Future expeditions will be safer
• Palebank and surrounding area will slowly recover
• Party prevented long-term ecological disaster

**If engine repurposed**:
• Converted to clean power source
• Could provide electricity to Palebank or Syrinlya
• Valuable diplomatic asset (Uthodurn would be very grateful)
• Engineering triumph

**If engine left running**:
• Disease continues spreading (slowly)
• Party has antidote for current outbreak but problem persists
• Future adventures may require returning

**TREASURE**:

After dealing with warden:

**On Warden's Body**:
• **Aeorian Power Core** (arcane battery, powers magical items for 1 year, worth 500 gp)
• Integrated weapons (salvageable, worth 300 gp to artificer)

**In Engine Room**:
• **Master Keycard** (grants access to all Aeorian facilities—extremely rare and valuable)
• **Aeorian Technical Manual** (tome of advanced arcane engineering, worth 1,000 gp, grants proficiency in Arcana if studied for 100 hours)
• 3 **Arcane Batteries** (worth 200 gp each)
• Preserved specimens in stasis chambers (valuable to researchers, 500 gp total if extracted safely)

**XP REWARDS**:
• Aeorian Engine Warden: 1,800 XP
• Successful controlled shutdown: +400 XP
• Repurposing engine: +600 XP (extraordinary achievement)
• Emergency shutdown (if survived explosion): +200 XP

**TIMING**: 45-60 minutes (this is climactic encounter)

**TRANSITION TO UID 2236**:

With engine dealt with (or not) and antidote secured, party exits Salsvault and begins journey back to Palebank.

**Irven's Reaction** (if waiting outside):
"You're alive! I saw magical surge from inside—thought you were dead. Did you get what you came for?"

**Journey back**:
Can be summarized quickly (montage) or played out if party wants.

Time is of essence—infected villagers in Palebank are worsening.

**DM NOTE**: This encounter rewards smart tactics over brute force. Party can:
• Fight head-on (hardest)
• Use controlled shutdown with defensive tactics (balanced)
• Pull emergency lever and risk explosion (risky but fast)
• Negotiate/distract warden while others work (clever)
• Retreat (valid choice—already have antidote)

Emphasize player agency. Multiple valid approaches.</text>
</encounter>

<encounter><name>Resolution and Return to Palebank</name><uid>2236</uid>
<text>READ ALOUD:

The ancient doors of Salsvault close behind you with a deep, echoing boom. The arctic wind hits immediately—bitter cold, but somehow more welcoming than the sterile chill of the Aeorian facility. You've secured the antidote. Lives hang in the balance.

The journey back to Palebank begins.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Return journey from Salsvault to Palebank Village, resolution of frigid woe outbreak

**SITUATION**: Party has secured the antidote and potentially dealt with the Arcane Engine. Now they must return to Palebank and distribute the cure before more villagers die. This encounter provides resolution to the adventure, consequences for choices made, and sets up potential future hooks.

**RETURN JOURNEY OVERVIEW**:

The return trip can be handled quickly (montage) or played out depending on party condition and time constraints.

**Timeline**:
• Exit Salsvault: 30 minutes
• Trek to Syrinlya: 3 days (or 2 with Irven's guidance)
• Boat journey to Palebank: 3 days
• **Total: 6-7 days**

**URGENCY**: Each day that passes, 1d4 infected villagers in Palebank die from frigid woe. Party should feel time pressure.

**MONTAGE OPTION** (recommended if party is exhausted):

Describe journey in broad strokes:
• Successful exit from Salsvault
• Irven's amazement at party's survival ("Most expeditions don't come back at all, let alone successful!")
• Crossing frozen wastes (uneventful if party already dealt with major hazards)
• Captain Tarina's relief at seeing them alive
• Boat journey homeward with growing anticipation

**Time Jump**: "Six days after entering Salsvault, your boat approaches Palebank's harbor..."

**DETAILED OPTION** (if time permits):

**Day 1 - Exiting Salsvault**:

Irven waiting at camp as promised. Sees party emerge:

"By the gods, you made it! And you're carrying... is that the cure?" *Eyes widen* "You actually did it. I owe you an apology—I didn't think anyone could survive Salsvault."

**If party shut down engine**: Irven notices facility lights dimming. "Did you turn off the... whatever powers that place? Might make future expeditions safer."

**Optional Encounter** (if DM wants final challenge):

**Cerberus Assembly Agents** (if antagonized earlier) attempt ambush to steal antidote. 3 Scouts + Mage Kellan (if alive) or substitute leader.

Can be resolved through combat or negotiation. If party shares cure formula or promises to credit Assembly, they stand down.

**Day 2-4 - Return Trek**:

Weather cooperates (gods favor heroes). Trek is uneventful. Party can take long rests, recover spell slots, heal wounds.

**Irven's Conversation** (during campfire):
• Asks about what party saw inside Salsvault
• Shares his own expedition story (lost friends to construct)
• Discusses future: "If you need a guide in Eiselcross again, you know where to find me. Partners' rates."
• May become recurring ally/contact

**Day 5-7 - Boat Journey**:

Captain Tarina pleased to see party alive: "Had a bet with my crew you'd be frozen statues by now. Glad I lost!"

Smooth sailing (no storm this time—narrative pacing).

**ARRIVAL AT PALEBANK VILLAGE**:

**Current Situation** (6-7 days after party left):

• **Elro Aldataur** has been coordinating quarantine efforts
• 2d4 additional villagers have died (roll or choose 4-6 deaths)
• Another 1d6 villagers are in critical condition (Stage 3, will die in 1d4 days)
• Village is in mourning but hasn't lost hope
• Tulgi Lutan (if alive) is near death (Stage 3, 1 day remaining)
• Hulil Lutan (if alive and captured) is unconscious, turning to ice

**Elro's Welcome**:

Elro meets party at docks, looking exhausted but hopeful:

"You're back! Please tell me you found something. We've lost six more people since you left. The remaining infected don't have much time."

**When party shows antidote**:

Elro's eyes fill with tears: "Thank the gods. Thank you. Let's distribute this immediately."

**DISTRIBUTING THE CURE**:

Party has 6 vials. Current need:
• 3-4 critical villagers (Stage 3)
• 2-3 early-stage villagers (Stage 1-2)
• Tulgi (if party chooses to save her)
• Hulil (if party chooses to save her)

**More patients than vials.** Party must make choices about who gets treated first.

**Priority Triage** (Medicine DC 12 or Elro's advice):
• Treat Stage 3 patients first (most critical)
• Then Stage 2, then Stage 1
• Stage 1 patients can wait 1-2 days if needed

**If party mentions antidote formula**: Elro can synthesize more doses, but needs 2-3 days and alchemical supplies. First batch will be ready too late for some patients.

**CURE EFFECTS**:

Within 1d4 hours of administration:
• Bluish skin tone fades
• Breathing normalizes
• Ice crystals dissolve
• Patient regains consciousness
• Speed returns to normal
• Complete recovery within 24 hours

**Emotional Scenes**: Describe families reuniting with cured loved ones. Village's relief and gratitude.

**DECISION POINT - TULGI LUTAN**:

If party captured Tulgi alive, she's imprisoned and dying. Party must decide:

**Option A: Give her antidote**
• She recovers
• Provides information about Uttolot family operations
• May become reluctant ally or recurring NPC
• Some villagers object ("She helped rob Pelc!")
• Moral: Mercy, second chances

**Option B: Let her die**
• She turns to ice statue within hours
• No information about Uttolots
• Some villagers approve ("Justice for Verla")
• Moral: Consequences for criminal actions

**Elro's Opinion**: "I believe in second chances. She's a criminal, yes, but she's also a victim of this disease. Your call."

**DECISION POINT - HULIL LUTAN**:

If party captured Hulil alive:

**Option A: Give her antidote**
• She recovers but is arrested
• Provides extensive information about Uttolot operations, Tiamat cult, artifact smuggling
• May face trial in Shadycreek Run or Palebank
• Intelligence goldmine for future adventures
• Moral: Pragmatism, information gathering

**Option B: Let her die**
• She turns to ice statue
• Uttolot family loses valuable lieutenant
• No intelligence gained
• Tidier resolution
• Moral: Justice for her crimes (robbery, murder conspiracy)

**Elro's Opinion**: "She's a war criminal. But the information she has could save lives in the future. Your call."

**DM NOTE**: No wrong answers. Both choices have valid justifications and consequences.

**VILLAGE CELEBRATION**:

After infected are cured, village holds celebration (next evening):

**Bonfire in village square**. Food, drink, music. Villagers express gratitude.

**Key NPCs Present**:
• **Elro Aldataur**: Offers permanent alliance with Palebank, promises resources for future needs
• **Recovered patients**: Thank party personally, offer small gifts
• **Village elder**: Public recognition, possibly reward

**Elro's Speech**:

"Friends, we gather tonight to celebrate life. Days ago, we faced extinction. Our people were dying of a plague none could cure. These brave souls—" *gestures to party* "—journeyed into the frozen hell of Eiselcross, braved ancient ruins and deadly guardians, and returned with salvation. They are heroes in the truest sense."

**If party shut down engine**:

"Moreover, they didn't stop at saving us. They eliminated the source of the plague itself. Future generations will be safer because of their courage."

**Village Rewards**:

**Monetary**: 500 gp total (village scrapes together what they can)

**Items**:
• **Palebank Medallion**: Token of friendship, grants advantage on Persuasion checks with Palebank residents
• Family heirlooms from grateful villagers (various minor magic items or valuable trinkets, DM choice)

**Reputation**: Party's fame spreads. +1 Reputation in Uthodurn territories.

**Future Hooks**: Elro mentions other Aeorian sites, strange occurrences, potential adventures.

**OPTIONAL EPILOGUE SCENES**:

**1. Cerberus Assembly Consequence** (if party interacted with them):

Week later, sending stone message from Agent Kellan (if alive):
"The Assembly acknowledges your success. We'll remember your cooperation." (if friendly)
OR
"Your interference has been noted. We don't forget slights." (if hostile)

**2. Uttolot Family Reaction** (if Tulgi/Hulil survived and talked):

Shadycreek Run criminal family is displeased. May send agents to retrieve their people or seek revenge. Future adventure hook.

**3. Irven's Letter** (if party befriended him):

"Found another interesting site in Eiselcross. Thought you might want first crack at it. Meet me in Syrinlya when you're ready."

**4. Cobalt Soul Interest** (if party brought back research data):

Prolix Yusaf contacts party: "The Cobalt Soul is very interested in your findings. Would you consider speaking at our archives in Rexxentrum? Generous compensation offered."

**5. Palebank's Future**:

If party repurposed engine: Uthodurnian engineers arrive to study power source, potentially establishing permanent outpost.

If party destroyed engine: Palebank remains quiet village, grateful for salvation.

**EXPERIENCE POINTS TOTAL**:

Recommended XP for entire Frozen Sick adventure:
• Investigation phase (uids 2221-2224): ~700 XP
• Croaker Cave (uids 2225-2227): ~2,100 XP
• Journey to Eiselcross (uids 2228-2230): ~1,800 XP
• Salsvault dungeon (uids 2231-2235): ~5,500 XP
• Resolution: +500 XP
• **Total: ~10,600 XP**

For party of 4: ~2,650 XP per character (roughly 1 level for levels 2-3)

**TREASURE SUMMARY**:

From entire adventure:
• Monetary: ~2,000 gp (various sources)
• Magic Items: +1 Wand, Ring of Cold Resistance, various potions, Aeorian artifacts
• Knowledge: Research data, maps, formulas (value to right buyers: 3,000+ gp)
• Reputation: Hero status in Palebank, contacts in Syrinlya and Uthodurn

**ADVENTURE CONCLUSION**:

With frigid woe cured and Palebank saved, party has completed their first major adventure for Northwatch Wardens. They've proven themselves capable of handling dangerous missions, made important contacts, and gained valuable experience.

**Elro's Final Words**:

"You've saved my village and potentially countless others. If you ever need anything—and I mean anything—Palebank and I are at your service. Stay safe out there, Wardens."

**THE END**

**DM NOTES FOR CAMPAIGN CONTINUATION**:

**Threads to Pull**:
• Uttolot family operations in Shadycreek Run
• Other Aeorian sites in Eiselcross (Aeor itself, other facilities)
• Cerberus Assembly interest in pre-Calamity weapons
• Tiamat cult activity (through Hulil connection)
• Aeorian artifacts spreading across Wildemount (Aeorian Echo theme)

<note><name>Adventure Overview</name><text><![CDATA[CAPSTONE ADVENTURE: CULT, DRAGON, AND MAGICAL CORRUPTION

OVERVIEW:
High-level adventure set in ruins of Temple of the Dragonknights. Cult is conducting ritual to empower their influence. Ancient dragon (Venomfang) senses rising magic and seeks to exploit it. Party must navigate politics, combat, and moral choices about how to handle both threats.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SITUATION:

Cult of the Dragonknights has occupied ancient temple ruins. They sense the Aeorian Echo and believe it is a sign to enact their ritual: creating a dracolich soul vessel to bind Venomfang into permanent alliance/servitude.

Venomfang senses this too and approaches temple to either stop them (protect territory) or join them (gain power).

Kidnapped children from various settlements are held as ritual components.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTIGATION PHASE:

Party learns about disappearances, traces cultists, discovers temple location.

APPROACH OPTIONS:
1. Frontal assault on temple
2. Infiltration of cult ceremony
3. Alliance with Venomfang to stop ritual (dangerous)
4. Sabotage from within

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMBAT ENCOUNTERS:

• Cultist patrols
• Temple guardian constructs
• Ritual chamber defenders
• Venomfang (if reached)
• Possible final battle: cultist leader + dragon + consequences

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:

1. DESTROY CULT: Kill cultists, free children, secure temple
   Consequence: Temple available for future exploration/control

2. VENOMFANG TREATY: Ally with dragon against cult
   Consequence: Dragon becomes powerful regional force (dangerous but controllable)
   Long-term: Venomfang owes party favor or is indebted

3. BOTH DESTROYED: Pit cult and dragon against each other
   Consequence: Temple ruins cleared but Venomfang weakened (may return for revenge)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SCALING:

Adjust dragon and cult member numbers based on party size.

REWARDS:
• Dragonknight artifacts
• Significant loot from temple
• Regional reputation shift
• Rescued children become future allies/obligations

CAMPAIGN IMPACT:
Party has directly confronted the secondary threat (cults/dragons exploiting the Echo). This clarifies that magic rising isn't just natural—it attracts dangerous entities seeking power.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Shouts echo from the town square ahead—a man's voice, ragged with grief and desperation. As you round the corner, you see the aftermath of violence.

A farmer, bloodied and barely standing, clutches a pitchfork as he argues with a guard captain in chain mail. Behind them, townspeople gather nervously, whispering among themselves. The farmer points north toward the forest, his hand trembling.

"My daughter!" he screams. "They took my daughter! We have to go NOW!"

The guard captain places a firm hand on the farmer's shoulder. "Joel, I can't leave the town undefended. Not with kobolds this aggressive. But these adventurers..." He turns toward you. "Maybe they can help."

<text><![CDATA[**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Town under attack by kobolds

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Party hears commotion outside The Flowing Mug Inn. Upon investigating, 4 town guards engage 6 green-skinned kobolds in street. Guards welcome party's help. Fast-paced skirmish to defend town.

**COMBAT START**:
Guards already engaged when party arrives:
• Guard Captain (AC 16, HP 25) fighting 2 kobolds
• 3 Guards (AC 14, HP 12 each) each fighting 1 kobold

Party can jump in immediately or assess situation (1 round).

**KOBOLD TACTICS**:
• Use Pack Tactics whenever possible (advantage when ally within 5 ft)
• Target weakest-looking characters first
• Sunlight Sensitivity (disadvantage on attack rolls in bright light)
• Flee when reduced below half original number (3 kobolds)

**TOWN GUARD TACTICS**:
• Protect civilians first, fight defensively
• Captain shouts orders: "Protect the Inn!", "Don't let them reach the market!"
• Guards wounded—fight at half HP already

**ENVIRONMENT**:
• Street outside Inn, 20 ft wide
• Market stalls provide half cover
• Civilians fleeing in background (10-12 NPCs running)
• Bright daylight (kobolds have disadvantage on attacks)

**AFTERMATH**:
After defeating kobolds:
• **Joel Andersmith** found wounded against Inn wall
• Farmer from north, kobolds raided his farm
• Family murdered, daughter Clementine taken
• Believes more kobolds in forest to north
• Town guards escort Joel inside, pay for stay
• Guards insist they must defend town, cannot pursue

**CAPTURING A KOBOLD** (Optional):
If party subdues kobold instead of killing:
• DC 15 Persuasion or DC 12 Intimidation reveals information:
  - **Poisontip Cavern** location: North past farmstead through brush
  - Town's **missing supplies**: Stored in cave
  - Joel's family fate: Wife and son dead, daughter Clementine taken alive (needed for ritual)
  - **Venomfang's intentions**: NOT revealed (kobold too afraid to speak dragon's name)

**XP REWARD**: 150 XP total (25 per kobold)

**HOOKS**:
• Joel's grief over family
• Daughter still alive and captive
• Kobolds connected to larger threat (dragon worship)
• Missing supplies affect whole town

**TIMING**: 15-20 minutes]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Kobolds Attack Town</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Introduction to Temple of Dragonknights adventure, establish Joel Andersmith's tragedy, create urgency.

**DIFFICULTY**: Easy for level 3-4 party. CR 0.125 × 6 = 150 XP total. Town guards assist, making this quick action encounter.

**DRAMATIC START**:
• Shouts and screams from outside Inn
• Crashing sounds, kobold yips
• Guard Captain: "TO ARMS! Kobolds in the streets!"
• Party rushes outside to see guards already engaged

**SUNLIGHT DISADVANTAGE**:
This encounter occurs during daytime:
• Kobolds have disadvantage on ALL attack rolls
• Makes them less threatening, appropriate for opening encounter
• Emphasizes kobolds are desperate/driven (attacking despite weakness)

**TOWN GUARD ALLIES**:
Guards actively help but shouldn't steal spotlight:
• **Guard Captain** (AC 16, HP 25): +5 to hit, 1d8+3 longsword
• **3 Guards** (AC 14, HP 12 each): +3 to hit, 1d8+1 spear
• Guards fight defensively, protect civilians
• Don't track guard actions blow-by-blow—narrate their contributions between PC turns

**PACK TACTICS**:

• Target weakest-looking PC (low armor, small size, wounded)

**FLEEING KOBOLDS**:
When 3 kobolds defeated, remaining 3 attempt to flee:
• Dash action toward town edge
• Players get opportunity attacks
• Fleeing kobolds don't attack back
• Capturing one alive provides valuable information

**INTERROGATION BENEFITS**:
Captured kobold reveals under pressure:
• **Poisontip Cavern** location (north past Andersmith Farm)
• **Missing town supplies** stored in cave
• **Clementine Andersmith** taken alive (needed for ritual—kobold doesn't know details)
• **Venomfang** name: DC 18 Intimidation—kobold terrified of dragon, refuses to speak name

**JOEL ANDERSMITH SCENE**:
After combat, spotlight Joel's grief:
• Found against wall, clutching wound
• Blood-soaked clothes, thousand-yard stare
• Bursts into tears when describing family's death
• "They took my Clementine... my little girl..."
• Guards gently help him inside, pay for room
• Gives party personal motivation beyond contract

**TOWN GUARD LIMITATIONS**:
Guards CANNOT leave town:
• "If more kobolds attack, town's defenseless!"
• "We're not adventurers—we defend the walls"
• Establishes party as town's only hope
• Guards provide healing potions (2 potions of healing) as thanks

**TREASURE & REWARDS**:
• 6 kobolds carry 1d4 silver each (avg 15 sp total)
• 2 potions of healing from guards
• 150 XP combat
• 50 XP for capturing/interrogating kobold
• Information pointing to next location

**PACING**: 15-20 minutes. Keep fast, heroic, urgent. This sets tone for rescue mission.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Andersmith Farm Investigation</name><uid>2171</uid>
<text>READ ALOUD:

Andersmith Farm sits about a mile north of town, where cultivated fields meet the dark line of the forest. Smoke still rises from scorched crops. The smell hits you first—blood, burnt vegetation, and death.

The barn's eastern half has collapsed into splintered wood. Slaughtered animals lie scattered across the yard. The farmhouse door hangs from one hinge, swaying slightly in the breeze.

This was not a random attack. This was a raid.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTIGATION SITE: AFTERMATH OF KOBOLD RAID

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
About a mile north of town bordering forest lies what's left of Andersmith Farm. Smoke rises along crops, slaughtered animals scattered across ground. House overlooks farmland on small hill to east, barn lies in semi-ruin to north bordering forest.

THE BARN:
Upon closer inspection, entire eastern half is caved in with piles of broken wood scattered. Blood tracks lead outside barn but eventually fade. DC 7 Survival check reveals tracks' destination: brush behind barn. Remnants of ransacked barrels and supplies remain.

THE FARMHOUSE:
Walking in front door (hangs off one hinge) reveals interior: main room (living/dining), two hallways branching left and right.

LEFT HALL:
- Left bedroom: Joel's son's room. He lies on ground with gut split open, simple shortsword at his side
- Right bedroom: Joel's daughter's room, empty except ruined furniture and bloodstained teddy bear in bed

RIGHT HALL:
- Left: Washroom
- Right: Bedroom with middle-aged woman leaning against large bed with slit throat

DC 10 Survival check reveals tracks leading to back side of barn.

CLUES:
Investigation establishes pattern of violence and abduction. Clementine Andersmith (daughter) was taken alive. Evidence points to organized raid, not random violence.</text>
</encounter>
<encounter><name>The Trail to Poisontip Cavern</name><uid>2172</uid>
<text>READ ALOUD:

Behind the barn, clear tracks lead into the forest—small, three-toed footprints in the mud. Dozens of them. The trail is fresh, no more than a few hours old.

Following the tracks, you soon encounter an unnatural thicket of thorny vines blocking the path. Beyond it, the forest grows darker, the canopy thicker. You can just make out a narrow trail continuing into the shadows.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXPLORATION &amp; HAZARD: FOLLOWING KOBOLDS TO THEIR LAIR

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
Party follows tracks revealing unnatural thicket. Can be cut through or, with DC 11 Investigation check, a vine connecting to mechanism can be found that pulls brush up. Following trail is 5 ft wide, must be traveled single-file.

TRAIL CLUES:
- Passive Perception 12: Finds small lock of human hair along trail
- Intelligence check DC 15: Discerns it's human hair

THE CREEK:
Following trail through woods for a mile leads to opening with small creek. Small slippery stones create path across creek.

CROSSING SAFELY:
- DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics check to cross safely
- Failure: Fall into creek where 2 Quippers sense fresh meat
- Success: 20 XP to each character

APPROACHING CAVE:
After crossing creek, spears topped with human skulls begin to dot the trail.

CAVE ENTRANCE GUARDS:
After curve in trail, DC 12 Passive Perception check signifies movement around corner. Turning corner reveals 2 kobolds roasting pig on spit. Currently eating so any stealth attempt succeeds.

ENCOUNTER REWARDS:
- Crossing creek: 20 XP each
- Defeating entrance guards: 50 XP divided amongst party</text>

<xp>50</xp>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Approaching the cave):

The narrow trail winds through the forest for nearly a mile before opening onto a small clearing. A creek cuts across your path, maybe ten feet wide, its water rushing over slippery stones. On the far bank, the trail continues into darkness.

But that's not what catches your attention.

Beyond the creek, jutting human skulls crown crude spears driven into the earth. They line the trail like grisly markers, pointing deeper into the forest. Past the final curve ahead, you smell smoke—and roasting meat.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Rounding the corner):

As you carefully round the final bend in the trail, you see the cave entrance—a dark opening in the hillside, maybe fifteen feet across. Outside, two small reptilian figures in crude leather armor crouch around a crackling fire.

Kobolds.

They're roasting something on a spit over the flames, laughing and arguing in their yipping language. Their backs are partially turned. They haven't noticed you yet.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Distracted guards at cave entrance

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
After following trail and crossing creek, party approaches Poisontip Cavern entrance. Around final bend, 2 kobolds tend roasting pig on spit, completely focused on cooking. Opportunity for stealth or surprise attack.

**INITIAL SITUATION**:
• **DC 12 Passive Perception**: Party spots kobolds before being noticed
• Kobolds laughing, arguing over who gets best cuts
• Fire crackles, pig dripping fat—distraction
• Kobolds' backs partially turned

**STEALTH APPROACH**:
• **DC 10 Stealth**: Move within 30 ft undetected
• **DC 13 Stealth**: Move within melee range (5 ft) undetected
• Success grants surprise round
• Kobolds currently eating—automatic success if party makes ANY stealth attempt

**SURPRISED KOBOLDS**:
If party successfully sneaks:
• Party gets full surprise round (kobolds can't act)
• Kobolds drop food, scramble for weapons
• One kobold yells warning into cave (alerts Area 1 kobold if combat loud)

**ALERT KOBOLDS**:
If party approaches loudly or kobolds notice:
• Kobolds grab weapons, yip warning
• Try to retreat into cave while shooting slings
• One stays behind to delay, other runs to alert cave

**KOBOLD TACTICS**:
• Retreat toward cave entrance (10 ft per round while shooting)
• Use Pack Tactics if both alive
• One flees into cave if reduced below half HP

• Loses surprise advantage in Area 1

**TREASURE**:
• Roasted pig (5 days rations)

<note><name>DM Guidance: Cave Entrance Guards</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Reward stealth/planning, provide easy encounter if party approaches smartly, establish cave dungeon tone.

**DIFFICULTY**: Trivial if surprised, Easy if alerted. CR 0.125 × 2 = 50 XP total.

**DISTRACTION ADVANTAGE**:
Kobolds are VERY distracted:
• Actively arguing over food
• Backs partially to trail
• Fire/cooking sounds mask party approach
• Automatic surprise if party uses ANY stealth

Reward clever play:
• Party sneaks up: Surprise round + advantage
• Party charges loudly: Kobolds grab weapons, no surprise
• Party parleys: Kobolds suspicious, attack after 1 round stalling

**SURPRISE ROUND MECHANICS**:
If party gets surprise:
• Party acts first, full round of actions
• Kobolds can't move or take actions/reactions
• After surprise round, roll initiative normally
• One-shot potential: Both kobolds may die before acting

**FLEEING KOBOLD WARNING**:
If one kobold flees successfully:
• Reaches Area 1 in 2 rounds (60 ft movement)
• Shouts "INTRUDERS!" in Draconic
• Winged kobold in Area 1 hears warning
• Area 1 encounter loses surprise element
• Winged kobold prepares ambush (Hides near entrance, readied action)

**CAMPFIRE HAZARD**:
Creative players can tip roasting pig:
• Action + DC 11 STR check to tip spit
• Creates 10-ft cone of hot grease
• Targets in cone: DC 11 DEX save or 1d4 fire damage
• Ground becomes difficult terrain (slippery grease)
• Extinguishes fire (removes light source)

**INTERROGATION**:
If kobold captured alive:
• DC 10 Intimidation: Reveals Area 1 winged kobold, Area 2 sleeping kobolds
• DC 13 Intimidation: Reveals Area 3 quippers, bridge trap
• DC 15 Intimidation: Reveals "robed ones" in temple with girl
• DC 18 Intimidation: Reveals Venomfang's name (kobold terrified, refuses unless seriously threatened)

**TREASURE DETAILS**:
• **Roasted Pig**: 5 days rations, well-cooked (Quality: delicious)
• **2d4 sp**: Kobold payment for guard duty
• **Crude Map**: Scratched on flat rock, shows Areas 1-4 layout (not Areas 5-6 Temple)

**STEALTH CONTINUATION**:
If party surprises and silently eliminates guards:
• Can drag bodies into bushes
• Extinguish fire to hide evidence
• Gain advantage on Area 1 entrance (winged kobold unaware)

**LOUD COMBAT CONSEQUENCES**:
If fight is noisy (shouts, weapon clashes, spells):
• Winged kobold in Area 1 hears (Passive Perception 10 vs DC 10)
• Prepares defensive position
• Area 2 sleeping kobolds wake on DC 15 Perception (disadvantage while sleeping)

**PACING**: 10-15 minutes if combat occurs, 5 minutes if party surprises and one-shots guards. Emphasize party's tactical advantage for smart approach.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You step through the cave entrance into absolute darkness. The temperature drops immediately, and the smell of damp stone fills your nostrils. As your eyes adjust—or you light a torch—you see a large natural cavern stretching ahead.

The chamber is two-tiered, with a rough-hewn second floor fifteen feet above you. And perched on that ledge, silhouetted against the darkness, is a kobold with leathery wings folded against its back.

It spots you. With a sharp hiss, it launches into the air.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Winged kobold scout in cavern entrance

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Party enters Poisontip Cavern's first chamber—large natural cavern with 15-ft elevated second level. Single winged kobold patrols area, immediately attacks intruders. Flying advantage makes this challenging for melee characters.

**CAVERN FEATURES**:
• **Total Darkness**: No natural light, darkvision required
• **Second Floor**: 15 ft above main floor, accessible by rough stairs
• **Cliff Edge**: 10-ft drop to underground lake (Area 3)
• **Small Passage**: To right of lake, DC 8 Acrobatics to cross safely
• **Rough Walls**: DC 12 Athletics to climb

**WINGED KOBOLD TACTICS**:
• Starts on second floor, spots party immediately (darkvision)
• Flies to ceiling (25 ft high) using flight speed
• Stays airborne, drops rocks from above
• Uses Pack Tactics if party has flying/ranged allies
• Dives to melee only if target isolated or prone

**FLYING COMBAT**:
• Kobold stays 20-25 ft high (out of melee reach)
• Drops rocks using Ranged Attack (+4, 1d6+2 damage)
• Moves 30 ft per round while attacking (flyby harassment)
• Disadvantage on ranged attacks vs kobold (partial cover from elevation)

**PARTY COUNTERS**:
• **Ranged Attacks**: Normal attack rolls (kobold AC 12)
• **Climbing**: DC 12 Athletics to reach second floor or walls
• **Spells**: Most spells work normally (ranged spell attacks)
• **Lure Down**: Kobold dives if target appears vulnerable (prone, low HP, isolated)

**KOBOLD MORALE**:
• Fights until reduced to 2 HP or less
• At 2 HP: Attempts to flee deeper into cave (Area 2)
• Yells "HELP! INTRUDERS!" in Draconic while fleeing
• If reaches Area 2, wakes sleeping kobolds

**CLIFF HAZARD**:
• Party members without darkvision may not see cliff edge
• Passive Perception 13 or active check DC 11 to notice cliff
• Failure: Character moves toward cliff (DEX save DC 13 to catch self)
• Falling: 10 ft into cold underground lake (1d6 bludgeoning + Area 3 quippers)

**TREASURE**:
• Winged kobold carries small pouch: 3d4 silver pieces
• Wears crude necklace with green glass "dragon scale" (worthless)

**XP REWARD**: 100 XP total (CR 0.25 for winged variant)

**TIMING**: 15-20 minutes (longer if party lacks ranged options)]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Winged Kobold Ambush</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Introduce flying combat, challenge melee-heavy parties, establish cave danger, test resource management (light sources, ranged attacks).

**DIFFICULTY**: Medium for level 3-4 party. CR 0.25 = 100 XP, but flying provides tactical advantage equivalent to CR 0.5.

**DARKNESS CHALLENGE**:
This encounter is SIGNIFICANTLY harder without darkvision:
• Characters without darkvision fight blind (disadvantage on attacks, enemies have advantage)
• Light sources (torches, Light spell, lanterns) become critical
• Kobold targets light-bearers first (extinguish light = tactical advantage)
• Party should discuss light solutions before entering

**LIGHT SOURCE TACTICS**:
If party uses torches/lanterns:
• Kobold tries to extinguish them (drop rocks on torch-bearer)
• Torch dropped: DC 12 DEX save or extinguished on impact
• Lantern more durable but limits hands for combat

Light spell:
• Cast on object/person—lasts 1 hour
• Kobold cannot easily extinguish
• Kobold avoids bright light area (60 ft bright light)

**FLYING HARASSMENT**:
Kobold uses hit-and-run tactics:
• Round 1: Fly to ceiling (25 ft), drop rock
• Round 2: Move 30 ft laterally, drop rock, end out of melee reach
• Round 3: Circle back, drop rock on different target
• Never stays in one place—constant movement

**GROUNDING THE KOBOLD**:
Creative solutions to bring kobold down:
• **Nets**: DC 13 DEX save or restrained, falls, flying speed 0
• **Grappling**: If PC can fly/reach, contested Athletics
• **Tasha's Hideous Laughter**: WIS save, falls prone laughing
• **Command (Fall)**: WIS save, falls prone (1d6 damage from 25 ft)
• **Environmental**: Thrown lantern (fire scare), collapsing stalactites (improvised attack)

**CLIFF HAZARD SPOTLIGHT**:
Use this to create tension for non-darkvision PCs:
• "You hear wings flapping echoing in dark space. Where are you moving?"
• "As you rush forward, your foot finds air instead of stone—make a DEX save!"
• Falling into lake triggers Area 3 quippers (4 quippers sense splashing)

**FLEEING KOBOLD CONSEQUENCES**:
If kobold flees to Area 2:
• Shouts "INTRUDERS! HELP!" in Draconic
• Wakes all 3 sleeping kobolds in Area 2
• Party faces 4 kobolds instead of 3 in next encounter
• Winged kobold joins Area 2 combat (provides aerial support)

**ALTERNATE RESOLUTION**:
Clever party may bypass combat:
• **Stealth**: DC 15 Stealth to sneak past while kobold patrols far side
• **Distraction**: Throw rock/object into lake, kobold investigates (1 round window)
• **Diplomacy**: DC 18 Persuasion in Draconic (kobold suspicious but might be bribed)

**SMALL PASSAGE CHALLENGE**:
After combat, party encounters narrow passage:
• 2 ft wide, requires squeezing (half speed, disadvantage on attacks/DEX saves)
• **OR** DC 8 Acrobatics to gracefully navigate
• Medium creatures squeeze, Small creatures walk normally
• Large creatures cannot fit (must find alternate route)

**PACING**: 15-20 minutes. Emphasize vertical dimension, darkness, environmental hazards. Reward creative problem-solving beyond "shoot it until it dies."]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Climbing to the second floor, you find yourself in a crude living area. Three makeshift tents—little more than stolen blankets strung over sticks—are spread across the chamber. A small cooking fire smolders in the center, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

Soft snoring echoes from within the tents. The kobolds here are sleeping.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT/STEALTH ENCOUNTER**: Sleeping kobolds and hidden treasure

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Elevated second floor chamber contains 3 kobolds sleeping in crude tents made from stolen blankets and hides. Excellent opportunity for stealth kills or surprise attack. Secret door on eastern wall hides town's missing supplies.

**INITIAL SITUATION**:
• 3 kobolds asleep in separate tents (8-10 ft apart)
• Soft snoring echoes in chamber
• Small cooking fire provides dim light (10 ft radius)
• Kobolds sleep on bedrolls, weapons nearby

**STEALTH ASSASSINATION**:
Party can attempt silent elimination:
• **DC 13 Stealth** per kobold to approach undetected
• Sleeping kobolds have **Passive Perception 8** (disadvantage while asleep = 3)
• Automatic critical hit on sleeping target (if surprised)
• One successful attack often kills kobold outright (5 HP, avg 9 damage)

**WAKING KOBOLDS**:
Kobolds wake on loud noise:
• **Combat sounds** from Area 1: DC 15 Perception (disadvantage asleep)
• **Shouting/spell with verbal components**: Automatic wake
• **Weapon clashing in tent area**: DC 10 Perception
• **Party member steps on pot/trips**: DC 8 Perception

**AWAKE KOBOLD TACTICS**:
If woken before combat:
• Scramble for weapons (1 round disadvantage while fumbling)
• Yell to wake allies

• Use Pack Tactics to gang up on single target

**TENT TREASURE**:
• **Northernmost Tent**: 25 gp in stolen coin, PUZZLE CLUE parchment
• **Southeast Tent**: 2 Potions of Healing in leather satchel
• **Southwest Tent**: Worthless trinkets (broken jewelry, buttons)

**PUZZLE CLUE PARCHMENT**:
Torn page from ancient book:
• **Front (Common)**: "Legends are born through blood and fire"
• **Emblem**: Snake-like dragon wrapped around sword (Dragonknights symbol)
• **Back (Draconic)**: "We brought the girl to the robed ones. Not sure why they wanted her, but whatever it takes to please the master."

Critical clue connecting Clementine to temple ritual.

**SECRET DOOR**:
Eastern wall conceals hidden door:
• **DC 10 Perception** to notice seam/draft
• **DC 14 Athletics** to push/budge heavy stone door open
• Inside: **Town's missing supplies** (flour, grain, tools, cloth)
• **Value**: 100 gp if returned to town
• **Reward**: 20 XP each character for recovering supplies

**STEALTH BONUS**:
If party eliminates all 3 kobolds without waking them:
• Bonus 50 XP for exceptional stealth
• Kobolds in Area 3-4 remain unaware (no alarm raised)
• Party can rest briefly in secure area

**XP REWARDS**:
• Defeating 3 kobolds: 75 XP total
• Recovering town supplies: 20 XP each + 100 gp reward
• Perfect stealth: Bonus 50 XP

**TIMING**: 20-30 minutes if combat, 10-15 minutes if stealth]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Sleeping Kobolds</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Reward stealth/planning, provide critical plot clue (parchment), offer moral choice (kill sleeping enemies), recovery point with treasure/healing.

**DIFFICULTY**: Trivial if stealthed, Easy if alerted. CR 0.125 × 3 = 75 XP total.

**STEALTH ASSASSINATION MECHANICS**:
Sleeping targets are extremely vulnerable:
• **Paralyzed condition** (cannot move or speak)
• **Automatic critical hit** if attacker has advantage (sleeping = advantage)
• **Passive Perception 3** (normal 8, disadvantage while sleeping = -5)
• One hit often kills: Crit dagger does 2×(1d4+modifier) = 6-12 damage (kobold has 5 HP)

**STEALTH APPROACH SEQUENCE**:
1. Party identifies 3 tents (visual or sound-based detection)
2. Each PC chooses target or coordination plan
3. Simultaneous DC 13 Stealth checks (group check optional)
4. Success: Approach undetected, surprise round
5. Each PC gets attack vs sleeping kobold (auto-crit on hit)
6. Any kobold surviving attacks wakes, screams alarm

**MORAL DILEMMA**:
Some players uncomfortable killing sleeping enemies:
• Frame as practical survival (kobolds killed innocent family)
• Offer alternative: Tie them up (DC 12 Sleight of Hand per kobold)
• Bound kobolds: Can interrogate, but risky (might escape, call for help)
• Non-lethal approach: Award same XP for creative problem-solving

**WAKING COMBAT TACTICS**:
If kobolds wake before being killed:
• **Round 1**: Kobolds scramble for weapons (disadvantage on attacks this round)
• **Round 2**: 2 kobolds charge nearest PC with Pack Tactics, 1 retreats to sling range
• **Round 3**: Ranged kobold aims for spellcasters/light-bearers
• **Morale**: Flee if 2 kobolds die (survivor runs to Area 4, alerts others)

**PUZZLE CLUE IMPORTANCE**:
Parchment is CRITICAL for temple:
• Front text hints at blood sacrifice puzzle
• Draconic text confirms Clementine's location (temple)
• Emblem identifies Dragonknights connection
• Players should recognize urgency (girl alive, ritual planned)

Reading Draconic:
• DC 15 Intelligence check for partial understanding
• Speak Languages/Comprehend Languages reads fully
• Kobold prisoner can translate if captured

**SECRET DOOR DISCOVERY**:
Encourage Investigation:
• "You notice draft of cool air from eastern wall" (Passive Perception 10)
• Active search: DC 10 Perception finds seam
• DC 14 Athletics to push heavy stone door (STR-based, multiple PCs can help)

Inside:
• Crates, barrels, sacks of supplies
• Town's missing goods (stolen during kobold raids)
• Returning supplies: Town grateful, 100 gp reward + reputation boost

**RESTING OPPORTUNITY**:
If party clears area stealthily:
• Secure location for short rest (1 hour)
• Kobolds in Areas 3-4 unaware
• Can use healing potions, recover hit dice
• Risk: If rest too long (>1 hour), temple ritual progresses (time pressure)

**TENT TREASURE DETAILS**:
• **25 gp**: Mix of silver/copper/gold coins
• **2 Potions of Healing**: In ceramic bottles, stoppered with cork
• **Worthless Trinkets**: Broken locket, brass buttons, child's toy (emotional gut-punch—belonged to Clementine)

**PACING**: 20-30 minutes if combat occurs, 10-15 minutes if party stealths perfectly. Emphasize player agency—stealth vs combat is player choice.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The passage opens into a vast underground cavern. Below you—far below—an underground lake stretches into darkness, its black water dotted with jagged stone stalagmites jutting up like teeth.

Spanning the lake is a rope-and-plank bridge, swaying gently in the cave's faint air currents. Some of the planks are missing. Others look rotted and fragile. The bridge is your only way across.

Faint bioluminescent fungi along the cavern walls provide just enough light to see the bridge—and the thirty-foot drop to the water below.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SKILL CHALLENGE & HAZARD**: Rickety bridge over quipper-infested lake

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Narrow rope-and-plank bridge spans 30-ft wide underground lake filled with sharp stalagmites and hungry quippers. Party must cross carefully to avoid falling into dangerous waters below. Pressure-plate trap waits on far side.

**THE BRIDGE**:
• **30 ft long**, swaying rope bridge with wooden planks
• Planks creak and groan under weight
• Some planks missing or rotted through
• 15 ft above water surface
• Dim bioluminescent fungus provides faint light (10 ft radius)

**CROSSING MECHANICS**:
• **Acrobatics check** based on weight:
  - **Under 80 lbs**: DC 0 (automatic success)
  - **80-130 lbs**: DC 5
  - **130-180 lbs**: DC 10
  - **180-230 lbs**: DC 15
  - **Over 230 lbs**: DC 20
• **Success**: Cross safely (half speed due to careful movement)
• **Failure**: Fall into water below (see Falling section)

**PARTY TACTICS**:
• Send lightest member first (scout safety)
• Spread out (don't overload bridge—max 2 creatures at once)
• Use rope for support (advantage on Acrobatics if someone holds rope from shore)
• Flight/Levitation bypasses challenge entirely

**FALLING INTO WATER**:
Character who fails check falls 15 ft into lake:
• **15% chance**: Land on stalagmite—1d6 piercing damage + underwater
• **85% chance**: Land in open water—no fall damage but underwater
• **Immediate danger**: 4 hungry quippers sense splashing
• **Swimming**: DC 10 Athletics to swim 15 ft to shore (underwater, can't breathe)

**QUIPPER FEEDING FRENZY**:
If anyone enters water (falls or dives intentionally):
• All 4 quippers attack fallen character(s)
• Blood Frenzy activates if target wounded
• Quippers swarm single target (Pack Tactics equivalent)
• Party members on bridge can attack quippers (disadvantage—moving target in water)

**PRESSURE-PLATE TRAP**:
5 ft past bridge on solid ground:
• **DC 13 Perception** to notice pressure plate
• **Triggers**: Any creature over 120 lbs steps on plate
• **Effect**: Rockfall from ceiling—1d6 bludgeoning damage to all in 5×5 ft area
• **Disarm**: DC 12 Thieves' Tools check (10 minutes)
• **Bypass**: Light creatures (under 120 lbs) can cross safely

**ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS**:
• **Flight/Levitation**: Bypass bridge and trap entirely
• **Feather Fall**: If someone falls, prevent damage/quipper attack
• **Water Breathing**: Dive intentionally, fight quippers underwater, swim across
• **Rope Trick**: Creative use of rope and pitons to reinforce bridge (advantage on checks)

**XP REWARDS**:
• Defeating 4 quippers: 100 XP total
• Disarming trap: 10 XP to whoever disarms
• Crossing without falling: 75 XP divided amongst party

**TIMING**: 15-20 minutes]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Bridge and Quippers</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Environmental hazard, skill challenge, resource drain, create tension before temple, punish careless/heavy characters.

**DIFFICULTY**: Low combat threat (CR 0 × 4 = 100 XP), but environmental hazard increases danger significantly.

**SKILL CHALLENGE EMPHASIS**:
This encounter is about PLANNING, not combat:
• Discuss approach before acting
• Use abilities/spells creatively
• Lightest party members cross first
• Heavy armor wearers face real challenge

**WEIGHT-BASED SCALING**:
Make weight matter:
• **Halfling Rogue** (35 lbs + 10 lbs gear = 45 lbs): DC 0, automatic success
• **Elf Wizard** (110 lbs + 20 lbs gear = 130 lbs): DC 5-10
• **Dwarf Fighter** (150 lbs + 50 lbs plate + pack = 200 lbs): DC 15
• **Half-Orc Barbarian** (250 lbs + gear = 280+ lbs): DC 20

Armor penalties:
• Heavy armor adds 45-65 lbs
• Consider removing armor to lower DC (takes 5-10 minutes, vulnerable)

**FALLING SEQUENCE**:
Narrate falling dramatically:
• "Bridge plank CRACKS beneath you!"
• "You plummet 15 feet toward dark water below!"
• **15% stalagmite**: "You slam into sharp rock jutting from water—1d6 piercing!"
• **85% open water**: "You splash into freezing underground lake!"

Underwater combat:
• Character submerged, can't breathe
• Quippers sense blood/movement immediately
• 4 quippers swarm as one attack per round

**BLOOD FRENZY DANGER**:
Quippers MUCH more dangerous if target wounded:
• Any HP damage triggers Blood Frenzy
• Advantage on all attacks vs wounded target
• +5 to hit with advantage = ~85% hit rate
• 4 quippers attacking = 4 hits per round likely
• Can quickly drain low-HP character

Rescue tactics:
• Party throws rope (Action + DC 10 Athletics to pull target out)
• Ranged attacks vs quippers (disadvantage—underwater refraction)
• Jump in to help (puts second character at risk)

**PRESSURE-PLATE TRAP**:
Often overlooked after bridge stress:
• Party breathes relief after crossing
• Steps onto solid ground without checking
• **DC 13 Perception** to spot slightly raised stone
• Failure: Rocks fall, 1d6 damage to 5×5 ft area

Clever bypass:
• Light character crosses first, spots trap from safe side
• Warns party, they walk around it
• Rogue disarms for bonus XP

**CREATIVE SOLUTIONS**:
Reward lateral thinking:
• **Mage Hand**: Triggers pressure plate safely (no weight)
• **Unseen Servant**: Tests bridge planks before crossing
• **Spider Climb**: Walk on walls/ceiling around bridge
• **Misty Step**: Teleport across (30 ft range exactly)
• **Jump Spell**: Triple jump distance, leap across
• **Shape Water**: Freeze quippers in ice (creative use)

**PACING**: 15-20 minutes. Create tension with creaking bridge sounds, describe yawning darkness below, emphasize risk before actions.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Beyond the bridge, a narrow passage leads to a small dead-end chamber. The ceiling here is high—twenty feet or more—and covered in sharp stalactites that hang like stone icicles.

In the center of the room sits a wooden chest, iron-bound and ancient. It's closed, but not locked.

The chamber is silent except for the occasional drip of water from above.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRAP ENCOUNTER**: Piercer ambush guarding treasure

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Small dead-end chamber contains single wooden chest. Ceiling is 20 ft high with sharp stalactites. One "stalactite" is actually a piercer—drops on first creature to open chest.

**THE CHAMBER**:
• 15 ft × 15 ft room
• Ceiling 20 ft high, covered in natural stalactites
• Wooden chest (unlocked) in center of room
• No other exits—dead end

**THE CHEST**:
• Old wooden chest, iron-bound, unlocked
• Contains **25 gp** in assorted coins
• Opening chest triggers piercer attack
• **No trap on chest itself**—danger comes from above

**PIERCER CAMOUFLAGE**:
• Piercer hangs directly above chest
• Indistinguishable from normal stalactites
• **DC 15 Perception** to spot piercer (examine ceiling before opening chest)
• **Passive Perception 15** notices something "wrong" about one stalactite

**ATTACK SEQUENCE**:
1. Character opens chest
2. Piercer drops immediately (no reaction—surprise attack)
3. **Drop Attack**: +5 to hit, 3d6 piercing damage (fall damage + impalement)
4. If hits, piercer attaches to target
5. If misses, piercer lands on ground, continues fighting normally

**ATTACHED PIERCER**:
If drop attack hits:
• Piercer clings to target's back/shoulders
• Target has disadvantage on attack rolls (awkward position)
• Piercer attacks same target each round (advantage—attached)
• **DC 10 STR check** (Action) to pry piercer off

**GROUND COMBAT**:
If piercer misses initial drop or is removed:
• Slow movement (5 ft per round)
• Can't climb back to ceiling (one-use drop attack)
• Attacks normally with bite (+5, 1d6+3)
• Fights until killed (no self-preservation instinct)

**TREASURE**:
• **25 gp** in chest (silver/copper/few gold)
• **Piercer shell** (after death): Can be crafted into armor component (worth 10 gp to armor smith)

**PARTY TACTICS**:
• Examine ceiling before opening chest (Perception check)
• Use Mage Hand to open chest from distance
• Ready attacks for when piercer drops
• Long pole/staff to poke ceiling (provoke early drop)

**XP REWARD**: 200 XP total (CR 0.5)

**TIMING**: 10-15 minutes]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Piercer Ambush</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Punish greed/carelessness, reward Investigation before action, classic D&D trap scenario, resource drain before temple.

**DIFFICULTY**: Medium for level 3-4 party. CR 0.5 = 200 XP, but surprise attack (3d6 damage) can severely wound or drop character.

**CLASSIC TRAP SCENARIO**:
This is archetypal D&D trap:
• Treasure in plain sight
• Danger hidden above
• Punishes rushing forward
• Rewards careful Investigation

Set expectation:
• Describe ominous stalactites hanging above
• "Chest sits in perfect center of room beneath sharp stone teeth"
• Give players moment to declare actions BEFORE opening chest

**PERCEPTION CHECK TIMING**:
Players should have opportunity to spot threat:
• **Before entering**: "You see small chamber with chest" (no Perception yet)
• **Upon entering**: "Dozens of stalactites hang from 20-ft ceiling" (invitation to investigate)
• **Active Investigation**: DC 15 Perception to spot piercer
• **Passive Perception 15**: "One stalactite directly above chest looks... wrong somehow"

If spotted:
• Party can attack from range (piercer AC 15, 22 HP)
• Piercer drops when reduced below half HP (11 HP remaining)
• Can use readied actions to attack as it drops

**DROP ATTACK DAMAGE**:
3d6 piercing averages 10.5 damage:
• Can instant-drop level 3 Wizard (avg 15 HP, already wounded)
• Significant chunk of Fighter/Barbarian HP
• Creates immediate crisis (attached monster)

Attached piercer mechanics:
• Target has disadvantage on attacks (thing on your back)
• Piercer has advantage on attacks (latched on)
• Removing requires Action + DC 10 STR check (not difficult, but costs Action)
• Allies can help remove (advantage on STR check)

**MAGE HAND SOLUTION**:
Smart players use Mage Hand:
• Opens chest from 30 ft away
• Piercer drops into empty space
• Party ready-attacks as it falls
• Award creativity—don't punish clever play

**ALTERNATE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS**:
• **10-ft pole**: Poke ceiling, provoke premature drop
• **Light spell on rock**: Throw at ceiling, illuminate piercer
• **Minor Illusion**: Create fake treasure, see if anything reacts
• **Animal Companion**: Send familiar/beast to investigate

**FAILING TO SPOT PIERCER**:
If no one checks ceiling:
• Character opens chest (describe shiny coins inside)
• "You hear faint scraping sound above—"
• **DEX save DC 13** to dodge falling piercer (halve damage on success)
• If save fails: Full 3d6 damage + attached condition

**ATTACHED PIERCER COMBAT**:
This is chaotic and urgent:
• Victim thrashes, trying to reach thing on back
• Allies must decide: Attack piercer (risk hitting ally) or help remove it
• Piercer bites every round (advantage = high hit chance)
• 3-4 rounds to kill it (22 HP, AC 15)

**GROUND COMBAT** (if drop misses):
Piercer becomes much less threatening:
• Speed 5 ft = nearly immobile
• Can't return to ceiling (Drop is one-time ability)
• Easy to surround and kill
• Anti-climactic if drop fails

**TREASURE WORTH RISK?**:
25 gp is modest treasure:
• Not life-changing wealth
• Enough to feel rewarding
• Not so much players feel cheated if they bypass trap
• Piercer shell adds 10 gp bonus (craftable into armor)

**PACING**: 10-15 minutes. Build suspense when party enters room, give Investigation opportunity, then sudden violent action if they proceed carelessly.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Poisontip Cavern Area 5: Blood Offering Puzzle</name><uid>2177</uid>
<text>READ ALOUD:

The passage opens into a larger chamber, this one clearly worked by hands rather than carved by nature. At the far end stands a massive stone double door, fifteen feet tall, engraved with the emblem of a dragon and knight locked in eternal combat.

Two lit torches flank the door, burning with steady magical flames in wall sconces. Between you and the door sits a stone offering bowl, filled to the brim with gold coins—perhaps twenty pieces, glinting in the torchlight.

The door has no visible handles, no locks. Just the emblem, and the bowl.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PUZZLE CHALLENGE: DRAGONKNIGHT DOOR

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
Area contains offering bowl, large stone double door, and two lit torches in sconces on each side of door. Door has Dragonknight emblem on it. Offering bowl is full of gold (20 gp).

SOLVING THE PUZZLE:
To open door, players must:
1. Pour portion of their blood into offering bowl
2. Light blood on fire using one of magical torches on wall

INVESTIGATION:
Emptying bowl of gold and making DC 10 Investigation check reveals dried blood on either gold or bowl (hints at solution).

OPENING DOOR:
Opening door yields 50 XP divided amongst party and reveals pathway and staircase going up to Temple proper.

XP REWARD: 50 XP divided amongst party</text>

<encounter><name>Temple Guardian Constructs: The Ascending Hall</name><uid>2185</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Beyond the Blood Offering Door, a narrow stone staircase rises into darkness. Ten feet wide, climbing forty feet in a switchback pattern. Torch sconces line the walls, but the torches burned out long ago.

The air is cold, stale, smelling of dust and old metal.

On the first landing, alcoves carved into the stone walls contain suits of armor—ceremonial dragonknight plate, ornately engraved with draconic symbols. They stand at attention like silent sentinels.

As you reach the first landing, there's a grinding sound.

Metal on stone.

Both suits of armor suddenly move. Empty helmets swivel toward you.

No warning. They attack.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Ascending stone staircase between Blood Offering Door and Temple proper

**ENCOUNTER TRIGGER**: 
When party opens Blood Offering Door and begins climbing stairs, ancient magic activates. Two **Animated Armor** sentinels stationed in alcoves along staircase activate and attack.

**ATMOSPHERE**:
Narrow stone staircase (10 ft. wide) rises 40 feet in switchback pattern. Torch sconces line walls but torches long since burned out. Air is cold, stale, smells of dust and old metal. Alcoves on each landing contain what appear to be decorative suits of dragonknight armor.

**ENCOUNTER BEGINS**:
As party reaches first landing (20 feet up), both suits of armor suddenly animate with grinding sound of metal on stone. Empty helmets swivel toward intruders. No warning—they attack immediately.

**ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**:

**Narrow Staircase**:
• Only 2 creatures can fight side-by-side
• Melee combatants can hold position and defend allies behind
• Ranged attackers can fire over shoulders of front-line fighters
• Difficult terrain if party tries to retreat quickly (DC 10 Dexterity to avoid falling)

**Height Advantage**:
• Party members higher on stairs have advantage on attacks against lower enemies
• Animated Armor can shove (Athletics contest) to push party members down stairs (1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen)

**Torch Sconces**:
• Can be torn from walls as improvised weapons (1d4 bludgeoning)
• Can be used to create light source (dark without them)
• DC 12 Strength check to break sconce free

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ENEMY STATS**: 2 Animated Armor (Modified)

**Dragonknight Animated Armor**:
• Medium Construct, unaligned
• AC 18 (plate armor), HP 33 (6d8+6), Speed 25 ft.
• STR 14 (+2), DEX 11 (+0), CON 13 (+1), INT 1 (−5), WIS 3 (−4), CHA 1 (−5)
• Damage Immunities: poison, psychic
• Condition Immunities: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned
• Senses: blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond), passive Perception 6
• Languages: —
• Challenge: 1 (200 XP)

**Antimagic Susceptibility**: Armor is incapacitated while in area of antimagic field. If targeted by *dispel magic*, armor must succeed on Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

**False Appearance**: While motionless, armor is indistinguishable from normal suit of armor.

**ACTIONS**:

**Multiattack**: Armor makes two melee attacks.

**Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: Both armors activate simultaneously on first landing. One descends to engage front-line, other holds high ground.

**Positional Control**:
• Armors try to block staircase, preventing party from advancing
• Use Shove action to push party members down stairs
• Focus attacks on whoever is highest on stairs (trying to block advancement)

**Defensive Formation**:
• If reduced to half HP (16 or less), armor retreats to higher position
• Uses Dodge action when below 10 HP to survive longer
• Will not pursue party if they flee down stairs—only guards ascent

**No Morale**: Constructs fight until destroyed. No fear, no retreat beyond tactical repositioning.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOOT &amp; INVESTIGATION**:

After defeat, each Animated Armor collapses into pile of masterwork plate armor:

**Dragonknight Ceremonial Armor** (2 suits):
• Functional plate armor (AC 18)
• Ornately engraved with draconic symbols and Dragonknight emblem
• Worth 750 gp to collector, 400 gp to armorer (heavy, 65 lbs each)
• Can be worn by party members (requires proficiency in heavy armor)

**DC 13 Investigation** of alcoves reveals:
• Faded murals showing Dragonknights in similar armor battling chromatic dragons
• Small inscription in Draconic: "The Worthy Shall Ascend"
• Dust patterns suggest armor stood here for decades undisturbed until cult arrived

**DC 15 Arcana** check:
• Determines activation magic is ancient abjuration ward
• Designed to activate when Blood Offering Door opened
• Magic is failing—armors are weaker than originally intended
• Originally would have been CR 2-3 each, now degraded to CR 1

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**XP REWARD**: 400 XP total (200 XP per Animated Armor)

**TREASURE**: 
• 2 suits of ceremonial Dragonknight plate armor (750 gp each to collector)
• Inscription clues about temple's original purpose

**SCALING**:
• **2 players**: Only 1 Animated Armor activates; other remains dormant
• **4-5 players**: Both armors at full strength
• **6+ players**: Add third armor from top of stairs (activated on Round 3)

**ESTIMATED TIME**: 15-20 minutes

**TRANSITION**: After clearing guardian constructs, party continues ascending to Temple proper (Area 1).]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Guardian Constructs</name><text><![CDATA[**ENCOUNTER PURPOSE**: Bridge between puzzle-solving and full Temple exploration. Rewards tactical thinking on narrow staircase.

**KEY TACTICS**:
Party should use environment to advantage:
• Narrow stairs limit enemy flanking
• Height advantage benefits ranged attackers
• Front-line can create choke point

**DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT**:
If party struggled with previous encounters or is low on resources:
• Reduce HP to 25 each
• Remove Multiattack (one Slam per turn)
• Have armors activate one at a time instead of simultaneously

If party is steamrolling:
• Increase HP to 40 each
• Add third armor from top of stairs
• Give armors +1 to AC (AC 19) representing better-preserved magic

**REWARDING CREATIVITY**:
• Allow clever use of environment (collapsing alcoves, breaking stairs, using magic to slip past)
• Armors are mindless—easily tricked by illusions or decoys
• *Dispel magic* or antimagic effects are instant win

**NARRATIVE PURPOSE**:
Shows temple was EXTREMELY well-defended in its prime. Current cult is exploiting ruins that are shadows of former glory. Foreshadows that Dragonknights were powerful, organized faction.

**LOOT CONSIDERATIONS**:
Ceremonial armor is valuable but HEAVY. Party must decide if worth carrying or leave for later retrieval. Introduces resource management decision.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Temple Courtyard Sentinels</name><uid>2186</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You emerge from the staircase into an open-air courtyard. The evening sky stretches above, sunset casting long shadows across cracked stone. Vines and moss have reclaimed much of this place, creeping up crumbling columns that line the perimeter.

In the center of the courtyard, a massive emblem is inlaid in the stone: a dragon wrapped around a sword. The symbol of the Dragonknights.

Across the courtyard, you can see the entrance to the temple proper.

But between you and it...

Two figures float in deliberate patrol patterns. Suits of armor wielding longswords, hovering three feet above the ground. Empty helmets. Hollow.

They stop. Turn toward you.

A voice echoes from both—resonant, hollow, ancient:

"State your purpose. Only those sworn to the Dragonknights may pass."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Open courtyard at top of ascending stairs, just before Temple Area 1

**ENCOUNTER TRIGGER**: 
When party emerges from staircase into courtyard, two **Helmed Horrors** patrol the space. They detect party immediately and challenge them.

**ATMOSPHERE**:
Open-air courtyard, partially overgrown with vines and moss. Cracked stone floor with Dragonknight emblem (large dragon wrapped around sword) in center. Crumbling columns line perimeter. Sky visible above—sunset casts long shadows. Entrance to Temple proper (Area 1) visible on far side.

**ENCOUNTER BEGINS**:
Two floating suits of armor wielding longswords patrol courtyard in deliberate pattern. When party enters, both Helmed Horrors stop, turn toward them, and speak in hollow, echoing voices:

**"State your purpose. Only those sworn to the Dragonknights may pass."**

**ROLEPLAYING OPPORTUNITY**:

**DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)**: Convince constructs party is here to stop cult desecration
• Success: Constructs pause, then stand aside: "The temple has been corrupted. Cleanse it." (No combat)
• Failure: "You are not sworn. You shall not pass." (Combat begins)

**DC 13 Intelligence (Religion or History)**: Recite Dragonknight oath or invoke their code
• Success: Constructs recognize oath as authentic, allow passage
• Failure: Constructs recognize false invocation, attack immediately with advantage on first round

**Show Dragonknight Emblem** (if party has parchment from Poisontip Cavern or armor from staircase):
• Automatic success—constructs acknowledge symbol and stand aside
• "The emblem is recognized. Pass, Knight, and reclaim what has been lost."

**Hostile Action**: Any attack or hostile spell triggers immediate combat response.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ENEMY STATS**: 2 Helmed Horrors (Modified)

**Dragonknight Helmed Horror**:
• Medium Construct, unaligned (following ancient orders)
• AC 18 (plate armor), HP 60 (8d8+24), Speed 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (hover)
• STR 18 (+4), DEX 13 (+1), CON 16 (+3), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 10 (+0)
• Skills: Perception +4
• Damage Resistances: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks
• Damage Immunities: force, necrotic, poison
• Condition Immunities: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned
• Senses: blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond), passive Perception 14
• Languages: understands Common, Draconic but can't speak (can speak challenge phrase via magic)
• Challenge: 4 (1,100 XP each)

**Magic Resistance**: Advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

**Spell Immunity**: Immune to three spells chosen by DM. Suggested: *fireball*, *lightning bolt*, *heat metal* (common dragon-slayer tactics they've adapted to resist).

**ACTIONS**:

**Multiattack**: Horror makes two longsword attacks.

**Longsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10+4) if used with two hands.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT TACTICS** (if fight begins):

**Coordinated Assault**:
• Both horrors attack most dangerous-looking party member (highest AC or visible spellcaster)
• Use flight to position advantageously—hover above melee range, swoop down to attack, ascend again
• Focus fire—both attack same target until it drops, then switch

**Defensive Formation**:
• If reduced to half HP (30 or less), horror retreats to entrance of Temple Area 1
• Uses courtyard pillars as cover (half cover, +2 AC)
• Will not leave courtyard—programmed to guard this specific area

**Environmental Use**:
• Fly above party to force disadvantage on melee attacks
• Attack from behind pillars for cover
• Position to control access to Temple entrance

**No Retreat**: Helmed Horrors fight until destroyed or party is driven off. Cannot be reasoned with once combat begins.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS**:

**Cracked Stone Floor**:
• DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to avoid tripping when moving quickly (half speed without check)
• Difficult terrain for first-time crossers (party can learn layout after Round 1)

**Crumbling Columns**:
• Provide half cover (+2 AC, +2 Dexterity saves)
• DC 14 Strength check to push column over onto horror (2d6 bludgeoning, horror prone)
• Collapsed column creates 5-foot square of difficult terrain

**Central Emblem**:
• Large (15-foot diameter) dragon-and-sword symbol inlaid in floor
• DC 14 Arcana: Detects residual divination magic—ancient alarm system (no longer functional)
• Standing on emblem: Advantage on Charisma checks to invoke Dragonknights (theatrical)

**Open Sky**:
• Full daylight (no darkness penalties)
• Flying creatures have unlimited vertical movement
• Ranged attacks beyond 60 feet have disadvantage due to sunset glare

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOOT &amp; INVESTIGATION**:

After defeat (or peaceful resolution), courtyard can be examined:

**Helmed Horror Remains** (if destroyed):
• 2 masterwork longswords (+1 longswords, 150 gp each)
• 2 suits of ornate plate armor (non-magical, decorative, 500 gp each to collector)
• Helmets contain faintly glowing crystals (power source, 100 gp each, useful for magical crafting)

**DC 13 Investigation** of courtyard:
• Faded murals on columns show Dragonknights swearing oaths before assembled crowd
• Inscription at base of each pillar in Draconic: "Vigilance", "Honor", "Sacrifice", "Duty"
• Evidence of recent cult activity: burned ritual circle near entrance, bloodstains (weeks old)

**DC 15 Arcana** examination of central emblem:
• Originally functioned as magical alarm—would alert temple when intruders entered
• Magic failed ~10 years ago (coincides with Aeorian Echo disruption)
• Could be reactivated with proper ritual and components (DM's choice if relevant)

**DC 12 Perception** around courtyard perimeter:
• Side alcove contains offerings left by pilgrims (long ago): rotted flowers, rusted weapons, old prayer scrolls
• One scroll intact enough to read (Draconic): prayer for strength in battle against chromatic dragons

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**XP REWARD**: 
• **Peaceful Resolution**: 1,000 XP total (for clever problem-solving and diplomacy)
• **Combat Victory**: 2,200 XP total (1,100 XP per Helmed Horror)

**TREASURE**:
• 2 +1 longswords (if combat occurred and horrors destroyed)
• 2 ornate plate armor suits (500 gp each)
• 2 glowing power crystals (100 gp each)
• Historical knowledge about Dragonknights (assists with future roleplay/investigation)

**SCALING**:
• **2-3 players**: Only 1 Helmed Horror present; reduce Persuasion DC to 13
• **4-5 players**: Both Helmed Horrors at full strength as written
• **6+ players**: Add third Helmed Horror OR give existing ones +15 HP each (HP 75)

**ESTIMATED TIME**: 
• **Peaceful Resolution**: 5-10 minutes (conversation and courtyard exploration)
• **Combat**: 20-30 minutes (challenging fight)

**TRANSITION**: 
After clearing or bypassing courtyard sentinels, party enters Temple proper (Area 1: Zombie Guardians).]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Courtyard Sentinels</name><text><![CDATA[**ENCOUNTER PURPOSE**: Provide alternative to combat. Reward player knowledge and creativity. Showcase temple's ancient glory.

**PEACEFUL RESOLUTION**:
This encounter is DESIGNED to be bypassed through roleplaying. Don't make it too hard:
• If party has Dragonknight emblem (from earlier encounters), automatic pass
• If party mentions stopping cult, allow Persuasion at reasonable DC
• If party researched Dragonknights beforehand, reward that preparation

**WHY ALLOW BYPASS?**:
• Conserves party resources for harder fights ahead (Venomfang, cultists)
• Rewards creative thinking over "attack everything"
• Builds world—shows Dragonknights were honorable, constructs still follow code
• Creates memorable non-combat moment

**IF COMBAT OCCURS**:
Helmed Horrors are TOUGH (CR 4 each, 2,200 XP total for pair). This is significant fight for level 2-3 party.

**Combat Balance Tips**:
• Use pillars for cover—make party adapt tactics
• Fly above melee range—force party to use ranged/magic
• Don't be afraid to have horrors retreat to Temple entrance if party clearly winning
• If TPK imminent, have horrors go dormant at 10 HP (magic failing, constructs losing power)

**REWARDING PREPARATION**:
If party has:
• Emblem from Poisontip Cavern → Automatic success
• Researched Dragonknights in Welton/Waystone → Advantage on checks
• Used *detect magic* or similar → Learn about constructs' magic resistance

**NARRATIVE FUNCTION**:
Establishes that:
1. Dragonknights were organized, honorable faction
2. Temple was sacred place, well-defended
3. Current cult desecration is serious violation
4. Ancient magic is failing (constructs can be reasoned with OR are weaker than prime)

**LOOT CONSIDERATION**:
+1 longswords are significant reward. If party bypasses fight peacefully:
• Consider placing equivalent loot elsewhere in temple
• OR allow peaceful resolution itself to feel like "bigger" reward (saved resources)

**TRANSITION NOTE**:
Whether peaceful or violent resolution, party should enter Temple Area 1 with sense of gravitas. This was holy place, now corrupted. They're reclaiming it.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Entering Area 1 - Hall of the Fallen):

The temple entrance opens into a long hall. Fifteen feet wide, lit by flickering wall sconces that cast dancing shadows across ancient stone.

Four stone coffins line the walls—two on each side. Ornate carvings cover their surfaces: dragons, swords, battles long past. These are the honored dead. Dragonknights laid to rest centuries ago.

In the center of the floor, a large emblem is carved into the stone. The same dragon-and-sword symbol you've seen before.

The air smells of dust, decay, and something else.

Corruption.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (If someone steps on the emblem):

The emblem flares with sickly green light.

All four coffin lids SLAM open simultaneously, the sound echoing like thunder in the confined space.

From within, figures rise.

What were once honored knights, now twisted by cult magic into shambling corpses. Zombies. Their tattered armor hangs from rotting flesh, empty eyes fix on you.

They lurch forward.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering Area 2 - Armory Chamber):

Beyond the Hall of the Fallen, a doorway opens into what was once an armory. Weapon racks line the walls, many still holding rusted blades and shields. Torn banners hang from the ceiling—Dragonknight colors, now burned and defaced.

In the center of the room...

A young elf woman is bound to a chair. Blood streaks her face. She's unconscious, head lolling forward.

Standing over her, a kobold cultist clutches a dagger. He spins toward you, eyes wide with fanaticism and fear.

"Stay back!" he hisses. "The master needs her alive, but I can still make her scream!"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (Entering Area 3 - Memorial Chamber):

The next chamber is quieter. Reverent.

A single brazier burns with cold blue flame in the center of the room. Along the far wall, a massive carved stone frieze depicts an epic battle: Dragonknights in gleaming armor facing down an enormous dragon. Fire. Blood. Victory.

The brazier casts three shadows across the floor—yours, dancing in the flickering light.

But there's a fourth shadow.

One that doesn't match any light source.

It moves.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MULTI-AREA COMBAT ENCOUNTERS**: Temple interior challenges

This encounter represents THREE separate combat situations within the corrupted temple. Party progresses through Areas 1-3 sequentially, facing different threats in each.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**AREA 1: ZOMBIE GUARDIANS (4 Zombies)** — 200 XP
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Hall of the Fallen—four stone coffins containing ancient Dragonknight remains

**TRIGGER**: Stepping on Dragonknight emblem in center of floor (DC 12 Perception to notice before stepping)

**ENCOUNTER START**:
• Floor emblem glows sickly green
• Four coffin lids SLAM open simultaneously
• Zombies rise from coffins (formerly honored Dragonknights)
• Cultist magic has reanimated them as guardians

**ZOMBIE TACTICS** (Nerfed for level 2-3 party):
• AC 8, HP 11 each (reduced from standard)
• Slow but relentless (speed 20 ft)
• Undead Fortitude: If reduced to 0 HP, DC 5 + damage CON save or drop to 1 HP instead
• Attack nearest living creature
• No tactical planning—mindless assault
• Damage: 1d4+1 bludgeoning (slam)

**ENVIRONMENT**:
• Four coffins provide half cover
• Narrow hall (15 ft wide) limits maneuverability
• Dim light from wall sconces
• Stone debris on floor (difficult terrain in 10-ft squares)

**TACTICAL NOTES**:
• Zombies emerge one per round (coffin 1 Round 1, coffins 2-3 Round 2, coffin 4 Round 3)
• Gives party time to position/react
• Turning Undead effective (channel divinity)
• Fire damage prevents Undead Fortitude (burns body completely)

**XP**: 200 XP total (50 per zombie)

**LOOT**: 
• 4 tarnished Dragonknight badges (10 gp each as historical artifacts)
• Rusty longsword (can be restored for 20 gp)

**LEVEL-UP NOTE**: Party should be level 2-3 by this point. Good stopping point for level-up if needed.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**AREA 2: SERA GELANADEL RESCUE (1 Kobold Cultist)** — 100 XP
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Armory Chamber—torn/burnt Dragonknight banners, weapon racks, torture implements

**SITUATION**: 
• Kobold cultist torturing young elf wizard **Sera Gelanadel**
• Sera bound to chair, bloodied, unconscious
• Cultist demands information about "rising magic" when party enters
• Cultist immediately hostile—attacks on sight

**KOBOLD CULTIST TACTICS**:
• Uses dagger + cultist spells (Command, Inflict Wounds)
• Casts Command ("Flee!") on strongest-looking party member
• Falls back to weapon racks for cover
• Threatens to kill Sera if party advances (bluff—DC 12 Insight reveals)
• Fights desperately—no retreat

**SERA GELANADEL**:
• **Young elf wizard** (Level 1 Wizard)
• Apprentice to famous wizard, sent to investigate arcane energy
• Unconscious when party arrives (0 HP, stable)
• Regains consciousness after 1d4 rounds or healing
• Has **2 Potions of Healing** on her belt
• Grateful, offers to join party temporarily (DM's choice—potential ally/NPC)
• Can provide lore about temple/Echo if questioned

**ARMORY TREASURE**:
• **DC 10 Investigation** on weapon racks: Reveals **Spear of the Dragonknights** (+1 spear, or change weapon type to fit party)
• Assorted mundane weapons (longswords, shields, crossbows)
• Kobold cultist carries ritual dagger (25 gp), cult medallion (Venomfang symbol)

**XP**: 100 XP (cultist defeat + Sera rescue)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**AREA 3: SHADOW AMBUSH (1 Shadow)** — 300 XP
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION**: Memorial Chamber—stone frieze depicting legendary dragon-slaying

**THE CHAMBER**:
• Single brazier burning with cold blue flame
• Massive carved stone wall (20 ft × 15 ft) showing epic battle scene
• Three shadows cast by brazier light (party members + brazier itself)
• **Fourth shadow** doesn't match any light source...

**FRIEZE ARTWORK**:
Depicts ancient Dragonknights battling enormous dragon:
• Knights wielding enchanted weapons
• Dragon breathing fire across battlefield
• Fallen heroes at dragon's feet
• Victory pose with dragon's severed head

**DC 18 Investigation**: Reveals hidden groove in stone containing **platinum ring** (250 gp value)

**SHADOW AMBUSH**:
• Shadow hides among normal shadows (DC 15 Perception to spot before ambush)
• Attacks when party examines frieze (surprise round)
• Emerges from wall shadow, drains strength
• Cultist magic bound shadow here as guardian

**SHADOW TACTICS**:
• Strength Drain attacks (2d6+2 necrotic, reduces STR by 1d4)
• Targets spellcasters/low-STR characters (instinctively knows weakest targets)
• Uses Amorphous trait to slip through weapon racks
• Sunlight Weakness: Disadvantage in bright light
• Shadow Stealth: Can hide as bonus action in dim light/darkness

**ENVIRONMENT**:
• Brazier provides bright light (20 ft) and dim light (40 ft)
• Extinguishing brazier helps shadow (removes light)
• Lighting torches/casting Light spell hinders shadow (disadvantage)
• Stone carvings provide half cover

**DANGER**:
STR drain is SERIOUS:
• Reduce target to 0 STR = instant death (soul consumed)
• Each point of STR drain lasts until long rest
• Can cripple fighters/barbarians (rely on STR for attacks/damage)

**XP**: 300 XP (CR 0.5 but dangerous abilities)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**COMBINED TACTICAL NOTES**:
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PACING**: 
• Area 1: 20 minutes (zombie combat)
• Area 2: 15 minutes (cultist fight + Sera roleplay)
• Area 3: 20 minutes (shadow combat more tactical)
• **Total**: 55 minutes for all three areas

**RESOURCE MANAGEMENT**:
Party should be wounded after these three encounters:
• Hit points depleted (multiple combats)
• Spell slots used (especially healing)
• Class abilities spent
• Creates tension before final ritual chamber (Area 4)

**SHORT REST OPPORTUNITY**:
After Area 3, party can rest in cleared Memorial Chamber:
• Recover hit dice
• Regain some abilities
• Plan approach to ritual chamber
• Heal Sera fully (if she's joining)

**TOTAL XP**: 600 XP divided amongst party]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Temple Interior Combat Sequence</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Multi-encounter gauntlet, resource management challenge, rescue mission, undead horror, build tension before final battle.

**DIFFICULTY**: Hard for level 2-3 party. Combined CR 0.25×4 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 600 XP across three separate encounters.

**THREE-PART STRUCTURE**:
These are NOT one combined fight—party faces them sequentially:
1. Area 1 zombies drain HP/resources
2. Area 2 rescue creates urgency/roleplay
3. Area 3 shadow drains STR (different threat type)

Each encounter weakens party for next, creating cumulative challenge.

**AREA 1: ZOMBIE TACTICS**:

**Staggered Emergence**:
Don't spawn all 4 zombies Round 1:
• Round 1: Coffin 1 slams open, zombie rises
• Round 2: Coffins 2-3 open, 2 more zombies
• Round 3: Coffin 4 opens, final zombie
• Gives party breathing room, prevents overwhelming

**Undead Fortitude Danger**:
Zombies are resilient:
• Standard damage: DC 5 + damage CON save to stay at 1 HP
• Example: 8 damage = DC 13 CON save (zombie has +5, likely succeeds)
• Fire damage bypasses this (burns body)
• Radiant damage bypasses this (Turn Undead, Sacred Flame)
• Critical hits bypass this

Tactical implications:
• Party learns "focus fire doesn't work—use fire!"
• Rewards clerics/paladins (Turn Undead destroys zombies CR 0.5 or lower)
• Teaches resource management (save spell slots or burn zombies now?)

**AREA 2: SERA RESCUE**:

**Roleplaying Opportunity**:
Kobold cultist can talk before fighting:
• "You're too late! The ritual progresses!"
• "Master Venomfang will feast on your bones!"
• Threatens Sera: "One step closer and she dies!"

Insight check (DC 12) reveals bluff—kobold won't kill valuable prisoner.

**Command Spell Disruption**:
Kobold's Command spell is annoying but not deadly:
• "Flee!" forces target to run away 1 round (wastes action economy)
• "Grovel!" forces prone (disadvantage on attacks, enemies get advantage)
• "Drop!" forces target to drop held item (weapons/shields clatter to floor)

Only affects one target, but strategically impactful.

**Sera as Ally**:
If party heals her:
• Regains consciousness, grateful
• Level 1 Wizard—knows Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield
• Can cast 2 spells before depleted
• Provides spell support (Magic Missile adds damage)
• DM choice: Temporary ally for dungeon or permanent NPC

**AREA 3: SHADOW HORROR**:

**Strength Drain Mechanics**:
This is LETHAL threat:
• Each hit: 2d6+2 necrotic + 1d4 STR reduction
• Average: 9 necrotic + 2-3 STR loss per hit
• Fighter with STR 16 → 3-4 hits = 0 STR = DEATH (no save, instant death)

Tactical urgency:
• Shadow MUST be killed quickly
• Focus fire essential
• Healing doesn't restore STR (only rest does)
• STR drain lasts until short rest minimum

**Light Tactics**:
Shadow has Sunlight Weakness:
• Bright light (torches, Light spell, Daylight): Disadvantage on attacks
• Brazier provides bright light in 20 ft radius
• Party should keep brazier lit, fight near it
• If shadow extinguishes brazier (can try), party in serious danger

**Shadow Stealth**:
Shadow hides as bonus action in dim light:
• Party loses sight of it
• Shadow gets surprise attacks
• Must use actions to search (Perception vs Stealth)

Counter: Light spell on rock, throw into shadows (illuminate area).

**COMBINED RESOURCE DRAIN**:

After all three encounters, party should be:
• HP depleted (zombies chip away, shadow deals heavy damage)
• Spell slots used (healing, damage spells)
• Class features spent (Channel Divinity, Action Surge, Rage)
• STR-drained characters weakened

This creates tension approaching Area 4 (ritual chamber):
• Do we push forward depleted?
• Do we rest here (risk ritual completing)?
• Do we retreat entirely (abandon Clementine)?

**SHORT REST DECISION**:
Memorial Chamber (Area 3) is secure after shadow defeated:
• Single entrance (easily watched)
• Brazier provides light/warmth
• Can rest 1 hour to recover hit dice

Risk vs reward:
• Rest: Regain HP/abilities, but ritual progresses (time pressure)
• Push on: Depleted resources, but interrupt ritual sooner

**PACING**: 55 minutes total. Keep encounters distinct, don't rush, allow tactical decisions and roleplay moments.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You burst through the doors into a large chamber. Forty feet across, vaulted ceiling twenty feet above. Tables and benches line the walls, and a podium stands at the far end holding an open spellbook.

But your eyes are drawn to the center.

A massive ritualistic rune circle—fifteen feet in diameter—is carved and painted on the floor in blood-red and sickly green. Five cultists stand around it, chanting in Draconic, their voices rising in unison.

Magical beams of purple-green energy lance from their outstretched hands.

And suspended ten feet above the circle, bathed in eldritch light...

Clementine Andersmith.

Joel's daughter.

She floats unconscious, her body glowing with unnatural energy. You can see her soul—literally see it—being pulled from her body into a glowing green crystal one of the cultists holds.

The ritual is almost complete.

The cultists notice you. One shouts: "Protect the ritual!"

You have seconds to act.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MAJOR COMBAT**: Interrupt ritual, rescue Clementine

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Party enters large ritual chamber to find 5 cultists mid-ritual. Clementine Andersmith (Joel's daughter) floats suspended 10 ft above ground, magical energy beaming from cultists' hands into her body. Soul gem ritual nears completion—party must act FAST.

**THE CHAMBER**:
• 40 ft × 40 ft room with 20 ft vaulted ceiling
• 4 tables with benches along walls
• Large ritualistic rune circle (15 ft diameter) carved/painted on floor
• Podium at south end with open spellbook
• Clementine suspended magically in center of rune circle
• Dim purple/green eldritch light illuminates room

**RITUAL IN PROGRESS**:
• 5 cultists stand around circle, chanting in Draconic
• Magical beams connect their hands to Clementine
• Clementine unconscious, glowing with unnatural light
• Soul gem ritual 75% complete (3-4 rounds until completion)
• Interrupting ritual requires: Killing all cultists OR breaking concentration of 3+ cultists

**CLEMENTINE'S CONDITION**:
• Unconscious, 0 HP (stable)
• Suspended 10 ft above ground by magic
• If ritual interrupted: Falls (1d6 fall damage unless caught)
• DC 13 Acrobatics to catch her safely
• Revives 1d4 rounds after ritual ends or with healing

**CULTIST TACTICS**:
• **Round 1**: Cultists maintain ritual, yell "Protect the ritual!" to each other
• **Round 2**: 2 cultists break away to engage party (3 maintain ritual)
• **Round 3**: 3 cultists engage, 2 maintain ritual (ritual accelerates—only 2 rounds remain)
• **Round 4+**: All cultists fight (ritual failed or nearing completion)

**RITUAL COMPLETION**:
If party doesn't interrupt by Round 5:
• Soul gem fully charges (glowing green crystal)
• Clementine's soul partially drained (permanently loses 1 CHA)
• Gem can be destroyed or taken (macguffin for Venomfang fight)
• Clementine falls unconscious, requires resurrection magic if soul fully drained

**BREAKING RITUAL**:
• Kill 3+ cultists: Ritual broken (not enough channelers)
• Damage Clementine: Breaks her attunement (risky—she's at 0 HP)
• Dispel Magic (DC 14): Breaks one cultist's connection
• Destroy rune circle: DC 12 Athletics to smash/deface (takes 1 action)

**CULTIST ABILITIES**:
• AC 12 leather armor
• HP 9 each
• Dagger: +3 to hit, 1d4+1 damage
• Spells: Command (1/day each cultist)
• Fanatic devotion: Fight to death, no morale checks

**ENVIRONMENT**:
• **Tables**: Provide half cover, can be flipped (action)
• **Rune Circle**: Difficult terrain (magical energy interferes with movement)
• **Podium**: Contains spellbook (evidence), 2 Potions of Healing in hidden compartment (DC 12 Investigation)
• **Benches**: Improvised weapons (1d4 bludgeoning)

**PODIUM INVESTIGATION**:
After combat, examining podium reveals:
• **Open spellbook**: Details soul gem ritual
• **DC 15 Arcana check**: Ritual creates soul gem for lich transformation
• **DC 14 History check**: Soul gems used in dracolich creation (Venomfang's goal!)
• **Hidden compartment**: 2 Potions of Healing (DC 12 Investigation)

**CLEMENTINE'S FATE**:
After rescue:
• Falls unconscious when ritual breaks
• Regains consciousness after healing or 1d4 rounds
• Traumatized but alive
• Provides information: "Green dragon...talked about becoming immortal..."
• Wants to return to father Joel immediately

**TREASURE**:
• Soul gem (if ritual completed—worth 500 gp, or destroy to prevent dracolich)
• 5 cult medallions (Venomfang symbol, 10 gp each)
• Ritual dagger (ornate, 50 gp)
• Spellbook (contains Detect Magic, Identify, Soul Cage rituals—200 gp value)
• 2 Potions of Healing in podium

**AREA 5: SLEEPING QUARTERS** (No combat):
Adjacent room—two chambers for previous Dragonknights:
• Now occupied by cultists (currently at ritual)
• Bedrolls, personal effects
• DC 10 Investigation: Potion of Healing in northernmost room nightstand
• Evidence of long-term occupation (cult has been here months)

**XP REWARD**: 500 XP (100 per cultist)

**TIMING**: 30-40 minutes]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Ritual Chamber Combat</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: High-stakes rescue, moral urgency (save child), revelation (dracolich plot), resource race (ritual timer), bridge to Venomfang.

**DIFFICULTY**: Hard for level 2-3 party depleted from Areas 1-3. CR 0.5 × 5 = 500 XP, but ritual timer increases pressure significantly.

**RITUAL TIMER MECHANICS**:

This encounter is a RACE against time:
• Ritual 75% complete when party enters
• Needs 5 rounds to finish (Rounds 1-5)
• Each round, ritual progresses 5% (80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%)
• At 100%: Soul gem charges, Clementine's soul drained

Visible progress indicators:
• **Round 1**: Clementine glows brighter, veins glow green
• **Round 2**: Soul gem materializes (faint green crystal above her)
• **Round 3**: Crystal grows larger, Clementine screams (unconscious but reacting)
• **Round 4**: Crystal pulses rapidly, Clementine's body convulses
• **Round 5**: RITUAL COMPLETE—blinding flash, Clementine falls

**TACTICAL URGENCY**:

Party must decide: Rush or plan?
• **Rush**: Charge straight at cultists (reckless but fast)
• **Plan**: Coordinate attacks, use spells (slower but safer)
• Timer punishes overthinking—act fast or lose Clementine

**CULTIST PRIORITY BEHAVIOR**:

Cultists are FANATICAL but tactical:
• **Rounds 1-2**: All 5 maintain ritual (ignore party unless attacked)
• **Round 3**: 2 break away to fight (desperate defense)
• **Round 4**: 3 fight, 2 maintain (ritual nearly complete—hold position)
• **Round 5+**: All fight (ritual finished or failed)

If 3+ cultists killed before Round 5:
• Ritual breaks (not enough channelers)
• Remaining cultists fight desperately
• Clementine falls immediately (catch her!)

**BREAKING THE RITUAL**:

Multiple approaches:
1. **Kill 3+ cultists**: Most direct, requires good damage output
2. **Destroy rune circle**: 1 action + DC 12 Athletics (smash with weapon/kick), breaks ALL connections
3. **Dispel Magic**: DC 14 check, breaks one cultist's connection (need to break 3)
4. **Damage Clementine**: 1 point damage breaks attunement (RISKY—she's at 0 HP, might kill her)

Creative solutions:
• Grapple cultists away from circle (breaks line of effect)
• Create wall of fire between cultists and Clementine (blocks channels)
• Counterspell ongoing ritual (DM discretion—creative use)

**CATCHING CLEMENTINE**:

When ritual breaks, she falls 10 ft:
• **DC 13 Acrobatics** to catch safely (within 5 ft of landing spot)
• **Failure**: She takes 1d6 fall damage (might die if ritual drained her to negative HP)
• Multiple PCs can ready actions to catch (advantage if 2+ attempt)

Heroic moment:
• "As magical energy dissipates, Clementine plummets—what do you do?"
• PC dives to catch her (cinematic description)
• Success: "You slide across floor, catching her inches from impact!"

**COMMAND SPELL SPAM**:

5 cultists × 1 Command each = 5 potential disruptions:
• "Flee!" (waste round running)
• "Grovel!" (go prone, vulnerable)
• "Drop!" (lose weapon)
• "Halt!" (freeze in place 1 round)

Targets prioritized:
• Cultists target biggest threat first
• Usually means high-damage martials or spellcasters approaching ritual

WIS saves required:
• DC 11 isn't high (50-60% success rate for most PCs)
• But failing means wasted round during timer

**CLEMENTINE AFTERMATH**:

If ritual interrupted:
• Soul intact (no permanent damage)
• Unconscious, 0 HP
• Regains consciousness after 1d4 rounds or healing
• Traumatized: "The dragon...so cold...wanted my soul..."
• Wants to see father Joel immediately

If ritual completed:
• Soul partially drained (permanent -1 CHA)
• Soul gem created (glowing green crystal, worth 500 gp)
• Can destroy gem (prevents dracolich creation) or keep it (valuable but dangerous)
• Clementine requires Greater Restoration to fully recover

**PODIUM LORE**:

Spellbook reveals Venomfang's plan:
• Creating soul gems for dracolich transformation
• Needs multiple gems (Clementine is first)
• Ritual powered by "rising magic from below" (The Echo!)
• Clementine chosen for "strong life force" (young, healthy, magically sensitive)

This connects:
• Temple cultists → Venomfang → The Echo
• Rising magic empowers dangerous rituals
• Dragons attracted to Echo energy
• Immediate threat (Venomfang) tied to campaign arc

**ENVIRONMENTAL TACTICS**:

**Tables**: Flip for cover (action, provides half cover vs ranged attacks)
**Benches**: Throw at cultists (improvised weapon, +STR to hit, 1d4 damage)
**Rune Circle**: Difficult terrain (magical energy slows movement)
**Podium**: Flammable (spellbook burns easily—deny cultists information)

Creative use:
• Throw bench to knock cultist out of circle formation
• Flip table to block line of effect to Clementine
• Kick cultist into rune circle (takes 1d4 force damage from disruption)

**PACING**: 30-40 minutes. Emphasize URGENCY throughout. Count rounds aloud: "This is Round 3—the crystal grows larger, pulsing faster!" Create tension with timer.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You've fought through every trial the temple could throw at you. Undead guardians. Cultists. Shadows that drain life itself. You've rescued Sera. You've saved Clementine.

Now you stand before the final chamber.

The doors are massive—carved stone depicting dragons and knights in eternal battle. You can hear chanting from within. Draconic. Rhythmic. Building to a crescendo that makes the air vibrate.

You push the doors open.

The ritual chamber is vast. Sixty feet across, vaulted ceiling thirty feet high. Ancient draconic script glows with sickly green light along every wall.

At the center stands a massive stone altar. Fifteen feet long, eight feet wide. Six glowing soul gems are arranged in a circle around it, pulsing with captured life force.

Two cultists in ornate robes chant in unison beside the altar, their hands raised toward the gems. The High Priest and Dragon Acolyte—cult leadership.

And perched atop the altar itself...

Venomfang.

The green dragon is eighteen feet of scales, acid, and malevolent intelligence. Her eyes glow as she watches you enter. Acid drips from her jaws, sizzling on the stone.

She smiles—a terrible sight on a dragon's face.

"Ah, more mortals come to witness my ascension."

Her voice is silk over steel.

"You've destroyed my servants, but you're too late. The ritual nears completion. Soon, I will transcend death itself—a dracolich, eternal and unstoppable."

She shifts on the altar, claws scraping stone.

"Surrender the child you rescued, and I may permit you to leave."

A pause. Her eyes gleam.

"Or stay, and become fuel for my transformation."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**BOSS ENCOUNTER**: Venomfang the Green Dragon + Cult Leaders

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Party reaches Area 6—the ancient ritual chamber at temple's heart. **Venomfang**, a young green dragon, oversees final stages of dracolich transformation ritual. Two cult fanatics (High Priest and Dragon Acolyte) chant over altar surrounded by soul gems. This is the campaign's climactic battle.

**THE CHAMBER**:
• 60 ft × 60 ft vaulted chamber with 30 ft ceiling
• Ancient stone altar at center (15 ft × 8 ft)
• Multiple soul gems arranged in circle around altar (glowing sickly green)
• Large opening in north wall (dragon's entrance/exit—50 ft wide)
• Pillars provide cover (4 pillars, 5 ft diameter each)
• Poisonous gas pools in corners (difficult terrain, 1d6 poison damage per round)

**VENOMFANG'S POSITION**:
• Perched on altar when party enters
• Green-scaled dragon, 18 ft long, acidic drool
• Eyes glow with malevolent intelligence
• Radiates confidence—knows she's superior

**INITIAL DIALOGUE** (Optional):
Venomfang WANTS to talk (buys time for ritual completion):
• "Ah, more mortals come to witness my ascension..."
• "You've destroyed my servants, but you're too late. The ritual nears completion."
• "Surrender the child you rescued, and I may permit you to leave."
• "Or stay, and become fuel for my transformation."

Party can negotiate (DC 18 Persuasion to gain ANY concessions):
• Venomfang interested in Echo knowledge—party can trade information
• Will NOT abandon ritual (99% complete)
• Might spare party if they leave immediately (50% chance she lies)
• Arrogant enough to monologue (buys party 1-2 rounds to prepare)

**COMBAT START TRIGGER**:
• Party attacks
• Party refuses to leave
• Ritual completes (2 rounds of dialogue maximum)
• Soul gem destroyed (cultists react violently)

**VENOMFANG'S TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: Intimidation + Poison Breath
• Uses Frightful Presence (30 ft radius, DC 14 WIS save or frightened 1 minute)
• Immediately follows with Poison Breath (30-ft cone, 42 poison damage avg, DC 14 CON save half)
• Targets maximum number of PCs with cone
• Stays on altar (high ground advantage)

**Round 2-3**: Multiattack + Mobility
• Flies to ceiling (80 ft fly speed)
• Multiattack: Bite + 2 Claws
• Targets spellcasters/ranged attackers first (knows they're most dangerous)
• Uses pillars for cover from ranged attacks

**Round 4+**: Breath Recharge + Divide and Conquer
• Recharge Poison Breath (rolls d6 each turn, recharges 5-6)
• When breath available: Dive-bomb with breath attack, fly away
• When breath unavailable: Land, Multiattack strongest target, fly away
• Cult fanatics provide healing/buffs (sees them as tools)

**CULT FANATIC TACTICS**:

**High Priest** (Cult Fanatic 1):
• Stays near altar, protects soul gems
• Casts Hold Person on melee threats (DC 13 WIS save)
• Uses Inflict Wounds on anyone approaching altar (3d10 necrotic)
• Heals Venomfang with Healing Word (1d4+2) as bonus action
• Fanatic Devotion: Advantage vs charmed/frightened

**Dragon Acolyte** (Cult Fanatic 2):
• Mobile combatant, harasses party flanks
• Casts Command ("Grovel!", "Flee!") to disrupt tactics
• Uses dagger for opportunity attacks
• Spiritual Weapon (bonus action, 1d8+2 force damage, attacks independently)
• Protects High Priest if threatened

**FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE**:
Frightened condition is SEVERE:
• Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls
• Cannot willingly move closer to Venomfang
• Lasts 1 minute (10 rounds) unless save repeated (end of each turn)
• DC 14 WIS save to resist initially
• Multiple PCs frightened = massive tactical disadvantage

**POISON BREATH DEVASTATION**:
Venomfang's signature attack:
• 30-ft cone (can hit 3-4 PCs if positioned well)
• 12d6 poison damage (avg 42)—can instant-kill low-HP characters
• DC 14 CON save for half damage (still 21 damage)
• Recharges on 5-6 (33% chance per round after used)

Tactical implications:
• Party should spread out (prevent multiple targets)
• Poison resistance/immunity hugely valuable
• After breath used, party has 2-3 rounds to attack freely
• When she inhales deeply (telegraph), RUN!

**FLYING COMBAT CHALLENGES**:
Venomfang uses mobility advantage:
• 80 ft fly speed (move 80 ft, stay out of melee reach)
• Only ranged attacks/spells can hit while airborne
• Can hover (no movement required to stay aloft)
• Dive attacks: Fly down, attack, fly back up (uses full movement)

Party counters:
• Readied actions (attack when she descends)
• Grounded spell (web, entangle doesn't work on dragon)
• Damaging spells (ranged spell attacks)
• Climb pillars for better reach (but vulnerable position)

**SOUL GEM MECHANIC**:
6 soul gems power ritual (Clementine's was 7th):
• Each gem contains stolen soul (kobolds from cave)
• Destroying gem: AC 13, 10 HP each, releases soul (ghost manifests, attacks dragon 1 round, disappears)
• Destroying 3+ gems: Ritual fails, Venomfang loses dracolich goal (ENRAGED, attacks recklessly)
• Cultists PRIORITIZE protecting gems over their own lives

**ENRAGED VENOMFANG**:
If ritual sabotaged (gems destroyed):
• +2 to hit, +1d6 damage on all attacks (primal fury)
• Reckless attacks (advantage on attacks, enemies get advantage against her)
• No longer uses tactics—charges strongest target
• Fights to death (won't flee)

**CULT FANATIC ABILITIES**:

Both fanatics have:
• AC 13 leather + shield
• HP 33 each
• Spellcasting (4th level)
• Dark Devotion (advantage vs charmed/frightened)

**Spells Prepared**:
• Cantrips: Light, Sacred Flame, Thaumaturgy
• 1st level (4 slots): Command, Healing Word, Inflict Wounds, Shield of Faith
• 2nd level (3 slots): Hold Person, Spiritual Weapon

**DEFEATING VENOMFANG**:
Dragon has 136 HP—requires sustained damage:
• Average party damage ~15 per PC per round
• 4-person party = 60 damage per round
• Estimated 3-4 rounds to kill (if focused fire)
• Poison Breath can eliminate PCs, reducing party damage output

**THREE OUTCOMES**:

**1. Destroy Dragon + Cult**:
• Standard heroic victory
• Rescue remaining prisoners (if any)
• Recover soul gems (can be returned to families or destroyed)
• Loot dragon's hoard
• Temple reclaimed

**2. Ally with Venomfang** (Extremely Difficult):
• DC 20 Persuasion + compelling offer (Echo knowledge, service, etc.)
• Venomfang spares party if they sabotage cult for her
• Dragon still evil—future consequences
• Morally ambiguous ending

**3. Let Them Fight**:
• If cult AND dragon both seem hostile to party
• Withdraw, let them battle each other
• Return when one side weakened
• Risky—winner might escape or complete ritual

**TREASURE**:
Dragon's hoard hidden behind altar (DC 12 Investigation):
• 800 gp in assorted coins
• 3 gems (100 gp each)
• +1 Longsword (Dragonbane—deals extra 1d6 vs dragons)
• Potion of Superior Healing (8d4+8)
• Spell scroll (Dispel Magic)
• Ancient Dragonknight armor (+1 Plate Armor, requires attunement)

**CAMPAIGN SIGNIFICANCE**:
This encounter ties together multiple threads:
• Dragon attracted by Echo's rising magic
• Cultists exploiting Echo energy for rituals
• Soul gems created using Echo-powered magic
• Venomfang's goal: Become dracolich to survive magical instability
• Evidence that Echo affects entire region (not just Waystone)

**POST-COMBAT**:
• Prisoners freed (Clementine, any others)
• Soul gems: Can be destroyed (releases souls) or kept (dangerous artifacts)
• Temple cleansed of corruption
• Joel reunited with Clementine (emotional payoff)
• Party recognized as heroes
• Foreshadowing: Other creatures attracted to Echo...

**XP REWARD**: 5,900 XP total (2,300 dragon + 450 per fanatic)

**TIMING**: 60-90 minutes for full boss fight]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Venomfang Boss Fight</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Epic campaign climax, test all skills learned, high-stakes combat, multiple resolution paths, thematic conclusion (Echo attracts dragons).

**DIFFICULTY**: Deadly for level 3-4 party. CR 8 + 2×CR 2 = 5,900 XP adjusted. Designed for depleted party (came through Areas 1-4).

**PRE-COMBAT SETUP**:

This is THE moment campaign builds toward:
• Dragon as embodiment of Echo-attracted threats
• Cultists as symptom of rising magic corruption
• Clementine rescue provides personal stakes
• Dracolich plot reveals larger conspiracy

Set the stage dramatically:
• "Vast chamber opens before you, ancient and desecrated"
• "Massive green dragon perched atop altar, eyes blazing with malevolent intelligence"
• "Two robed figures chant in Draconic, hands raised over glowing soul gems"
• "Venomfang's head swivels toward you: 'Ah. More mortals.'"

**VENOMFANG'S PERSONALITY**:

NOT mindless beast—intelligent, cunning, arrogant:
• Believes herself superior to "soft-scaled humanoids"
• Views cult as useful tools (doesn't care about them)
• Wants dracolich transformation to survive Echo's instability
• Arrogant enough to monologue (classic dragon trait)
• Will negotiate if benefits her (not out of mercy)

Negotiation possibilities:
• Party offers Echo knowledge: DC 18 Persuasion, Venomfang interested (might spare them)
• Party offers to serve: DC 20 Persuasion, Venomfang considers (probablyies)
• Party threatens: DC 25 Intimidation, Venomfang laughs (impossible without leverage)

**FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE OPENING**:

Venomfang uses this FIRST (free action):
• 30-ft radius from her position
• All PCs within radius: DC 14 WIS save or frightened 1 minute
• Frightened = disadvantage on attacks/checks, can't approach her
• Creates immediate crisis (half party potentially neutralized)

Tactical impact:
• Frightened martials can't close distance to melee
• Frightened casters have disadvantage on spell attacks
• Splits party (frightened PCs retreat, others advance)

Breaking frightened:
• WIS save at end of each turn (DC 14)
• Calm Emotions spell (instant cure)
• Move outside Venomfang's sight (no longer aware of her)

**POISON BREATH DEVASTATION**:

This is Venomfang's win condition:
• 30-ft cone = can hit 3-4 PCs if positioned well
• 12d6 damage (42 average) = instant kills level 3 Wizard (avg 15 HP)
• Even with successful save (half damage = 21), severely wounds
• Recharge 5-6 = 33% chance per round after first use

Telegraph breath attack:
• Round before: "Venomfang inhales deeply, throat glowing sickly green"
• Gives players 1 round to scatter/prepare
• Don't ambush with breath—give fair warning

Party spreading out:
• Breath cone is directional (30 ft long, 30 ft wide at end)
• PCs 15+ ft apart can't all be caught in single cone
• Forces Venomfang to choose targets (can't hit everyone)

**MULTIATTACK LETHALITY**:

When breath unavailable, Venomfang uses Multiattack:
• Bite: +7 to hit, 2d10+4 piercing + 2d6 poison = avg 22 damage
• 2 Claws: +7 to hit each, 2d6+4 slashing = avg 11 damage each
• **Total per round**: 44 damage if all attacks hit

Target priority:
1. **Spellcasters** (biggest threat—range, control, healing)
2. **Ranged attackers** (archers, crossbow users)
3. **Wounded targets** (finish them off)
4. **Healers** (prevent party recovery)
5. **Melee** last (least threatening to flying dragon)

**FLYING TACTICS**:

Venomfang abuses 80 ft fly speed:
• Round 1: Frightful Presence + Poison Breath, fly to ceiling (30 ft up)
• Round 2: Fly 80 ft laterally (over party), multiattack caster, end out of melee reach
• Round 3: Hover 30 ft up, multiattack archer, wait for breath recharge
• Round 4: If breath recharged, dive-bomb with breath, fly back up
• Round 5+: Repeat cycle

Party can't easily reach her:
• Melee useless unless she lands
• Ranged attacks/spells only option
• She knows this—exploits mobility advantage

Grounding the dragon:
• Damage her enough (below half HP = 68 HP), she gets desperate
• Soul gems destroyed = enraged, lands to recklessly attack
• Environmental collapse (destroy pillars, cave ceiling)—creative solution

**CULT FANATIC COORDINATION**:

Fanatics SUPPORT dragon actively:

**High Priest**:
• Round 1: Cast Hold Person on biggest melee threat (DC 13 WIS save or paralyzed)
• Round 2: Cast Spiritual Weapon (bonus action, attacks independently at +5 for 1d8+2)
• Round 3+: Inflict Wounds on anyone approaching altar (3d10 necrotic)
• **Bonus actions**: Healing Word on Venomfang (1d4+2 HP)—keeps dragon alive longer

**Dragon Acolyte**:
• Round 1: Cast Shield of Faith on Venomfang (bonus action, +2 AC = 20 AC total!)
• Round 2: Command "Grovel!" on dangerous PC (prone, disadvantage)
• Round 3: Cast Spiritual Weapon, attacks flanking targets
• Round 4+: Harass with dagger, opportunity attacks, protect High Priest

Combined with dragon = action economy nightmare:
• Dragon: 3 attacks per round
• Spiritual Weapons: 2 bonus action attacks (1d8+2 each)
• Cult Fanatics: 2 actions (spells or attacks)
• **Total**: 7 attacks per round against party

**HOLD PERSON THREAT**:

Paralyzed condition is LETHAL:
• Can't move, speak, or take actions
• Auto-fail STR and DEX saves
• Attacks against paralyzed creature have advantage
• Attacks within 5 ft are automatic crits

If PC paralyzed near Venomfang:
• Dragon targets them immediately
• Multiattack with advantage, all hits are crits
• Bite crit: 4d10+4 piercing + 4d6 poison = avg 44 damage
• 2 claw crits: 4d6+4 each = avg 22 damage each
• **Total**: 88 damage = instant death for most level 3-4 PCs

Breaking paralysis:
• WIS save at end of each turn (DC 13)
• Ally casts Lesser Restoration (ends paralysis)
• Kill the fanatic who cast it (concentration breaks)

**SOUL GEM SABOTAGE**:

6 soul gems power ritual (Clementine's would have been 7th):
• Each gem AC 13, 10 HP
• Destroying gem releases trapped kobold soul (ghost manifests)
• Ghost attacks Venomfang for 1 round (4d6 damage), then disappears
• Destroying 3+ gems = ritual fails

Venomfang's reaction to sabotage:
• **ENRAGED**: Roars in fury, loses tactical thinking
• +2 to hit, +1d6 damage on all attacks (primal rage)
• Reckless fighting (advantage on attacks, enemies get advantage vs her)
• Lands, charges party (no more flying away)
• Fights to death (won't flee or negotiate)

Cultist reaction:
• Both fanatics immediately target gem-destroyer
• Hold Person + Inflict Wounds combo (DC 13 WIS save or 3d10 necrotic)
• Spiritual Weapons redirect to gem-destroyer
• Fanatical desperation (fight to death)

**ACTION ECONOMY CRISIS**:

Party is severely outnumbered in actions:
• 4 PCs = 4 actions + 4 bonus actions per round
• Dragon + Fanatics = 2 actions + 2 bonus actions + 3 attacks (multiattack) + 2 spiritual weapons
• **Enemy total**: 7-9 attacks vs party's 4 attacks

Equalizing action economy:
• Kill cultists first (reduces enemy actions from 9 to 3)
• Disable cultists (Hold Person them, turn tables)
• Summon allies (familiars, conjured creatures, NPCs)
• Sera can help if rescued in Area 2 (Magic Missile support)

**ENVIRONMENTAL TACTICS**:

**Pillars**: Half cover from ranged attacks, can climb (DC 12 Athletics) for height advantage
**Altar**: Full cover if behind it, cultists use it defensively
**Poison Gas Pools**: Difficult terrain in corners, 1d6 poison per round (push enemies into it)
**Dragon Exit**: 50 ft opening, Venomfang can flee through it if desperate
**Ceiling**: 30 ft high, Venomfang hovers here to stay out of melee

Creative solutions:
• Collapse pillar onto dragon (DC 15 STR check, 4d10 bludgeoning if hits)
• Lure dragon into poison gas (dragon immune but blocks movement)
• Block dragon exit with Wall of Stone/Stone Shape (trap her inside)

**VICTORY CONDITIONS**:

**Total Victory**: Dragon + both fanatics killed
• Rescue prisoners
• Destroy soul gems (release trapped souls)
• Loot dragon hoard
• Temple reclaimed

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Win but with casualties
• 1-2 PCs dead
• Survivors heavily wounded
• Soul gems destroyed or lost
• Moral weight of deaths

**Negotiated Resolution**: Venomfang spared in exchange for Echo knowledge
• Dragon leaves temple, abandons ritual
• Party lives but dragon still exists (future threat)
• Morally ambiguous (did they do right thing?)

**Defeat**: TPK or retreat
• Venomfang completes ritual (becomes dracolich egg—future campaign)
• Prisoners consumed
• Temple remains corrupted

**TREASURE DISTRIBUTION**:

Dragon hoard (behind altar):
• **800 gp**: Enough to fund party for months
• **3 gems (100 gp each)**: Emeralds, sapphires, rubies
• **+1 Longsword (Dragonbane)**: +1 to hit/damage, +1d6 vs dragons
• **Potion of Superior Healing**: 8d4+8 HP (avg 28 HP)—save for emergencies
• **Spell Scroll (Dispel Magic)**: One-use, valuable
• **+1 Plate Armor**: AC 19, requires attunement, Heavy Armor proficiency

Who gets what:
• Dragonbane to melee fighter (dragon-slayer legacy)
• Plate Armor to highest-AC character (Fighter/Paladin)
• Potion distributed or held by healer
• Gold split evenly

**POST-COMBAT AFTERMATH**:

If victorious:
• Clementine reunited with father Joel (emotional scene)
• Town celebrates party as heroes
• Northwatch Wardens Guild offers official membership
• Evidence of Echo's influence (dragon attracted to rising magic)
• Foreshadowing: "If one dragon came, others may follow..."

Campaign implications:
• Echo confirmed as regional threat (attracts powerful creatures)
• Magic destabilization ongoing (more adventures needed)
• Dracolich plot reveals intelligent forces exploiting Echo
• Party now famous (reputation has consequences)

**PACING**: 60-90 minutes. This is CLIMAX—give it weight, drama, tension. Don't rush. Let players feel accomplishment when they win.]]></text></note>

<note><name>Adventure Overview</name><text><![CDATA[ONE-SHOT ADVENTURE: CHAOS, COMEDY, AND MAGICAL INSTABILITY

OVERVIEW:
Comedy adventure with real stakes. A wizard (Shinebright) was transformed into a sheep by a magical mishap. Party must recover him while dealing with:
• Magical artifacts misfiring
• A dracolich wyrmling running loose
• Rural chaos and absurdity
• Noke (villain) making things worse

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SITUATION:

Wizard Shinebright attempted to duplicate a powerful magical artifact (Wand of True Polymorph). Spell critically failed. Wand destabilized. Shinebright turned into sheep. Wand's magic scattered across countryside, causing:
• Livestock shapeshifting randomly
• Random polymorphs affecting people and animals
• Bed dragon wyrmling escaping from trapped stasis

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ENCOUNTERS:

• Noke's modified wand misfires
• Polymorphed animals (some hostile, some helpful)
• Bed dragon wyrmling (young, confused, not inherently hostile)
• Shinebright as a sheep (party must find him among hundreds of sheep)
• Environmental comedy (towns where reality is fluid)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RESOLUTION:

• Recover Wand of True Polymorph (can be stabilized or destroyed)
• Un-polymorph Shinebright (requires wand or powerful magic)
• Decide Noke's fate (capture, kill, or let escape)
• Deal with bed dragon wyrmling (befriend, trap, or fight)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THEMES:

This adventure is thematically significant despite comedy:
• Magic is destabilizing (artifacts fail in unpredictable ways)
• The Aeorian Echo is making arcane mishaps more likely
• Even young dragons are drawn to rising magic
• Chaos has consequences (even when it's funny)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SCALING:

Bed dragon wyrmling adjusted for party level.
Can be run as 2-hour one-shot or expanded to full session.

REWARDS:
• Wand of True Polymorph (if stabilized and kept)
• Loot from Noke's hideout
• Bed dragon companion (if befriended)
• Lore confirmation: magic everywhere is destabilizing]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You're enjoying a rare afternoon of downtime [in a tavern / at your base / walking down the street] when you hear it:

Clattering hooves. Surprised yelps. Frantic bleating.

Before you can react, a sheep bounds toward you.

It's a regular sheep in every way—fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns—except for one detail: it's carrying an elaborate scroll in its mouth.

The sheep tries to get close to the most magically-gifted member of your group and waves the scroll insistently, letting you take it if you reach for it.

A wax seal on the scroll reads: "Scroll of Speak With Animals (Modified)."

The sheep appears to nod enthusiastically and bleats with what sounds like... urgency?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (If scroll is used):

The moment the spell activates, the sheep's bleating morphs into cultured, elven-accented Common—albeit with a slight hint of a bleat.

"Oh, thank the gods! You can understand me!"

The sheep practically vibrates with relief.

"My name is Finethir Shinebright. I am—or rather, I *was*—a wizard of considerable talent. I require your immediate assistance in recovering an extremely powerful magical artifact from a dangerous, possibly insane wizard who—"

A loud howling fills the air, accompanied by angry yells and screams growing closer.

The sheep's eyes widen.

"Oh no. They've found me."

<text>ADVENTURE HOOK: DESPERATE WIZARD SEEKS HELP

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
Party is enjoying downtime (tavern, street, base) when a frantic sheep carrying an elaborate scroll bounds toward them. The sheep is actually Finethir Shinebright, a wizard polymorphed by his apprentice's malfunctioning wand.

THE APPROACH:
Sound of clattering hooves, surprised yelps, and frantic bleating fills the air. Before the party can react, a sheep bounds toward them. The beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way - fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns - but it carries an elaborate scroll in its mouth.

THE SCROLL:
The sheep tries to get close to the most magically-gifted party member and waves the scroll at them. The wax seal identifies it as "Scroll of Speak With Animals (Modified)". If anyone says this aloud, the sheep nods enthusiastically and bleats.

ACTIVATING THE SCROLL:
Simply reading it aloud activates the spell. All party members hear the sheep's bleating morph into cultured, elven-accented Common with a slight hint of a bleat.

SHINEBRIGHT'S PLEA:
After establishing that the party understands, the sheep introduces itself as Finethir Shinebright, a wizard in dire need of aid. He recognizes them as adventurers and desperately needs help taking back an extremely powerful magical artifact from a dangerous, possibly insane wizard (his former apprentice Ahmed Noke).

SHINEBRIGHT'S STORY (if party listens):
- Until two years ago, he owned a tower on the outskirts of town
- He was a transmutation wizard of considerable talent
- His most prized possession: Wand of True Polymorph (incredibly rare)
- One fateful night, his apprentice Ahmed Noke stood over him clutching the wand
- When Shinebright demanded to know what was happening, he could only produce an angry "baaaaah"
- He became a prisoner in his own garden, forced to graze while polymorphed guards (wolves, bears) watched
- Last night Noke left the door open; Shinebright snuck in and stole a Scroll of Speak to Animals
- He rushed into town searching for someone magical enough to activate the scroll
- To return to his true form, he needs another dose of True Polymorph, which means reclaiming his wand
- Noke still lives in Shinebright's old tower (southeast of town) and keeps the wand on him at all times

ROLEPLAYING SHINEBRIGHT:
- Arrogant, self-obsessed, inflated ego
- Worst-suited personality to be transformed into a sheep
- Exudes air of fussy, bookish intellectualism despite woolly form
- Generally good-hearted but oblivious to others' needs
- Loudly complains about others' inability to grasp "poly-planal transweave theory"
- Two years as sheep taught him lots about grass, nothing about humility
- True form: willow-thin high elf, straw-colored hair, extremely long nose
- Once spoken of with respect by nobles, merchants, and arcanists

PROMISES AND REWARDS:
Shinebright promises great rewards if mercenary. He's wealthy and powerful in his true form (or was). He's willing to commit to deals he knows he can't actually fulfill. Desperate circumstances make him flexible with truth.

TRANSITION:
Shortly after Shinebright starts telling his story, howling fills the air - Guz and his polymorphed guards are hunting the sheep.</text>
</encounter>
<encounter><name>Shepherds, Crooks: Guz and the Polymorphed Guards</name><uid>2161</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The howling grows louder, accompanied by angry yells and the occasional scream. The crowd around you begins to part nervously.

Then you see the source:

A huge half-orc swaggers toward you, pushing his way through the crowd without a care for anyone in his path. In front of him walk what appear to be large wolves wearing iron collars with strangely intelligent eyes. Behind him, a hulking figure in a dirty brown cloak follows with footfalls loud enough to be heard over the ruckus.

The half-orc sets his small eyes on you and strides forward, one hand resting on the hilt of a greatsword.

His voice is a low growl:

"That sheep is Master Noke's. He desires to have it back. It is of great... sent-ee-ment-all value."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMBAT ENCOUNTER: RETRIEVING "MASTER NOKE'S SHEEP"

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
Loud howling accompanies angry yells drawing closer. Guz (half-orc bruiser) arrives with polymorphed guards: 3 Wolves with iron collars and strangely intelligent eyes, plus a hulking figure in dirty brown cloak (polymorphed Brown Bear).

GUZ'S DEMAND:
Guz strides forward with one hand resting on greatsword hilt: "That sheep is Master Noke's... he desires to have it back."

He claims the sheep escaped and is of great "sent-ee-ment-all" value to his master. Any mention of Shinebright's true nature is met with hollow, mirthless laughter.

GUZ'S APPROACH:
- Not bright, but loyal and determined
- Prefers violence and intimidation
- Willing to offer bribes and magical favors if that seems effective
- Trackers know Shinebright is there no matter how well party hides him
- Will attack without warning if he feels he's not making progress

CREATURES:
• GUZ (Half-Orc, CR 2): AC 14 (leather armor), HP 67, Greatsword +5 to hit, 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage. Reckless ability (advantage on all melee attacks, but attacks against him also have advantage). Whirling Greatsword can target two separate enemies.
• 3 WOLVES (MM p341): Polymorphed guards with INT 10, follow tactics intelligently
• 1 BROWN BEAR (MM p319): Polymorphed guard in cloak, will drop hood and charge with terrible roar

TACTICS:
- Guz charges frontline alongside Brown Bear
- Wolves cut around behind party to grab Shinebright (uses Pony stats: MM p325, but INT 18, WIS 14)
- Wolves intend to capture Shinebright, not kill him
- If successful, Guz and allies set off for Noke's tower (potential chase scene)

BATTLE ENVIRONMENT:
Location determines terrain:
• Inn: Tables and overturned chairs create difficult terrain
• Street: Frightened passers-by form zones of difficult terrain

ROLEPLAYING GUZ:
- Hulking half-orc brute viewing violence as only sensible method
- Incredibly loyal to Noke (who doesn't care what creatures look like)
- Not intelligent, easily confused by quick-talking
- Confusion makes him angrier
- Tries to use long complicated words picked up from Noke (doesn't understand them)

AFTER COMBAT:
Once Noke's guards defeated/distracted/dealt with, Shinebright pleads with party. Without their help, he's doomed. Noke has many more guards. If party feeling mercenary, he reminds them he's powerful and wealthy wizard (in true form) and promises great rewards.

<note><name>DM Guidance: Guz's Hunting Party</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: First major combat, establishes Noke's threat level, introduces polymorphed allies concept.

**DIFFICULTY**: Challenging for level 2-3 party. CR 2 + 3×CR 0.25 + CR 1 = 700 XP total.

**TACTICAL NOTES**:
• Guz charges directly at frontline fighters using Reckless
• Brown Bear supports Guz, focusing on melee threats
• Wolves use Pack Tactics and attempt to flank/capture Shinebright
• Wolves prioritize grappling sheep (Shinebright) over killing PCs
• If any wolf successfully grabs Shinebright, it attempts to flee

**POLYMORPHED GUARDS**:
These are VICTIMS, not villains. They retain human minds but are trapped in beast forms. Reward non-lethal takedowns:
• Unconscious polymorphed guards revert to human form when Noke dies
• Guards who survive will provide information about Noke's tower
• Killing them denies party future allies/information

**SCALING**:
• 2 players: Remove 1 wolf, reduce bear HP to 25
• 3 players: Remove 1 wolf
• 5+ players: Add another wolf OR give Guz +20 HP
• Party struggling: Have 1-2 wolves flee at half HP

**ENVIRONMENTAL TACTICS**:
Encourage creative use of terrain:
• Tavern: Overturn tables for cover, throw mugs/bottles
• Street: Crowd provides difficult terrain, can be used to block wolf movement
• Any location: Fire sources frighten wolves (disadvantage on attacks near flames)

**SHINEBRIGHT DURING COMBAT**:
• Uses Pony stats but won't fight (coward)
• Bleats warnings about flanking wolves
• If injured, becomes indignant: "I'm a WIZARD, not mutton!"
• Can be convinced to use Dash action to stay away from wolves

**AFTER COMBAT**:
If Guz captured alive:
• DC 15 Intimidation: Reveals Noke's tower location and guard count
• DC 18 Persuasion: Admits he owes Noke his life (Noke accepted him despite half-orc heritage)
• Won't betray Noke willingly, but can be tricked

If all defeated:
• Shinebright grateful but panicked—more guards will come
• Urges immediate departure toward tower
• Promises rewards grow more extravagant with each passing minute

**PACING**: 25-35 minutes. Keep combat dynamic with wolves repositioning each round.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>The House in the Woods: Noke's Tower</name><uid>2162</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The path to Noke's Tower cuts off from the main road a few miles out of town, darting between a gap in the bushes. It's a well-trodden route that soon weaves between tall oak trees.

After perhaps a mile, the trees suddenly open up, and you see something remarkable:

Rather than stone or glass, the house before you has been formed from the living branches of four sturdy oak trees. These have been shaped and woven to create three thick platforms rising like steps into the canopy.

The lowest platform is roughly 40 feet across and sits about 10 feet from the ground, surrounded by a bowl of branches filled with flowers and small trees—a garden suspended in the air.

The middle platform is the largest, about 60 feet across and 20 feet up, fully enclosed with walls of twisted branches. You can see window-sized gaps and a door at the point closest to the garden.

The highest platform sits 30 feet up, much smaller, connected to the central one by a gentle ramp.

Scattered beneath the platforms are two small wooden huts and a large outhouse.

And there, lounging on the garden platform—three massive apes, sleeping or playing with oversized dice. Iron greatswords are stuck into the ground beside them.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INFILTRATION/COMBAT: APPROACHING AND ENTERING NOKE'S STRONGHOLD

ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW:
Party travels to Noke's tower (few miles out of town) to reclaim the Wand of True Polymorph. Tower is magically constructed from living oak trees with multiple platforms. Polymorphed guards patrol grounds.

THE PATH:
Path cuts off from main road, darting between gap in bushes. Well-trodden route weaves between tall oak trees for roughly a mile. Tracks easily reveal many feet and paws - fresh sets match Guz's group.

TOWER DESCRIPTION:
Rather than stone or glass, the house is formed from living branches of four sturdy oak trees, shaped and woven to create three thick platforms:

LOWER PLATFORM (Garden):
- 40 ft across, sits 10 ft from ground
- Gentle slope of roots/branches connects to main path
- Branches curl around base creating rough bowl
- Flowers and small trees grow around edge

MIDDLE PLATFORM (Main Living Area):
- 60 ft across, 20 ft above ground
- Fully enclosed with twisted branch walls
- Evenly spaced window-sized gaps
- Door at point closest to garden platform
- Interior divided into: library/lab, sitting room, dining room/kitchen
- Untidy bookshelves line walls
- Worktables covered with ink-spattered notes and anatomical diagrams

UPPER PLATFORM (Bedroom):
- 30 ft above ground, smaller than others
- Linked to central platform by small slope
- Contains wardrobe, large wooden bed, cluttered dressing table

GROUND STRUCTURES:
- Two small wooden huts (guard quarters with beds and detritus)
- Large outhouse

INITIAL GUARDS:
• 3 APES (MM p317): Sleeping or playing oversized dice on lawn. Iron greatswords stuck into ground nearby. Wield greatswords: Slash attack +5 to hit, 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage. Act intelligently, flee below half HP.
• 1 BROWN BEAR: In outhouse taking care of business

DOOR:
Almost always locked. DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to break down, or DC 12 Thieves' Tools to pick.

NOKE'S LOCATION:
In central platform working furiously on new spells. If he notices party: "Return the sheep - in return I will not destroy you all."

If they talk, he reveals:
- Reasons for hating Shinebright (decades as apprentice with no advancement)
- Boasts disjointedly of own achievements
- Asks if they killed Guz (visibly upset if yes)
- Orders attack if they refuse to return Shinebright

NOKE'S COMBAT TACTICS:
• AHMED NOKE (CR 2, 450 XP): AC 12, HP 55, Speed 30 ft
  - STR 9, DEX 14, CON 12, INT 16, WIS 12, CHA 10
  - Saving throws: Intelligence +5, Wisdom +4
  - Skills: Arcana +6
  - 7th level spellcaster, spell save DC 14, +6 to hit
  - Cantrips: Ray of Frost, Mending, Prestidigitation, Message
  - 1st level (4 slots): Expeditious Retreat, Jump, Thunderwave
  - 2nd level (3 slots): Enlarge/Reduce, Levitate
  - 3rd level (3 slots): Haste, Slow
  - 4th level (1 slot): Polymorph
  - Dagger: +5 to hit, 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage

- Offensively weak but buffs allies dramatically
- Casts Enlarge/Reduce on Brown Bear when it emerges (increases damage)
- Supplements allies with Ray of Frost to slow fleeing party
- Focuses on maintaining concentration
- When fight clearly lost or player gets too close: casts Expeditious Retreat, flees to central platform, locks door
- Runs to bedroom, casts True Polymorph on his bed

LURING NOKE OUT (Optional):
Extremely difficult. Noke is naturally paranoid. Shinebright's escape worsened outlook. However, lust for fame/power slightly outweighs fear. Very skilled liars with devious plan and luck might tempt him with prestigious, lucrative contract. If he leaves, takes all remaining guards and is quick to suspect betrayal.

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
Stealthy party may steal wand while Noke sleeps. Lucky rolls and inventive tactics may allow disarm. Don't force story back to "ideal path" - allow natural development. Provide hint of wand dangers before players try using it (sparks unnaturally when touched, Noke warns them).

MODIFIED WAND OF TRUE POLYMORPH:
Long thin twig from oak tree, fitted with bulbous rune-inscribed iron band, cracks running along length. Holds 1d4-1 charges (minimum 1) of True Polymorph, resets at dawn. Requires 1 hour attunement by spellcaster.

DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals modifications left wand extremely unreliable.

Each charge use requires DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check:
- Success: Spell casts normally, DC permanently increases by 1
- Fail by 5 or less: Target becomes Gibbering Mouther (MM p157), attacks nearest target mindlessly. Cannot be undone below 9th level spell, cannot be cancelled by concentration. Target gets saving throw.
- Fail by 5+: Above consequence PLUS wand explodes (1d12 force damage per remaining charge to all within 10 ft), wand destroyed

TIMING: Major infiltration/combat encounter, 45-60 minutes</text>

<encounter><name>Noke's Polymorphed Guard Compound</name><uid>2187</uid>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD (Breaking into central platform):

The door splinters open with a final strike.

Inside, bookshelves line the walls, laden with volumes and scrolls. Worktables are covered with ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts.

And there, in the center of the room, stands a thin human man with wild eyes and disheveled hair. He clutches a slender wand crackling with unstable magic.

Ahmed Noke.

His voice is sharp, manic:

"Return the sheep! In return, I will not destroy you all!"

His eyes dart between you and Shinebright.

"Did you kill Guz? Did you KILL MY MAN?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READ ALOUD (If combat begins and Noke flees to bedroom):

Noke casts a spell and vanishes into the upper platform, moving with unnatural speed. You hear his footsteps racing up the ramp, then—

A thunderous CRACK.

The ceiling of the upper platform explodes outward in a shower of wooden splinters.

Emerging from the hole is... a dragon?

No—it's carved from wood, its wings billowing bedsheets, its tail a mass of twisted pillows. The Bed Dragon Wyrmling spreads its impossible wings, and atop its back rides Ahmed Noke, wand raised high.

"You should have returned the sheep!"

<note><name>DM Guidance: Tower Compound Guards</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Perimeter defense encounter, introduces tower defenses, rewards stealth/creativity.

**DIFFICULTY**: Moderate for level 2-3 party. 3×CR 0.5 + CR 1 = 500 XP total.

**INITIAL SETUP**:
• 3 Apes gambling with oversized dice on lawn (Perception DC 12 to notice party)
• Brown Bear in outhouse (emerges Round 2-3 after hearing combat)
• Greatswords stuck in ground near apes (can be grabbed as bonus action)

**TACTICAL NOTES**:
• Apes coordinate using human intelligence
• One ape alerts others if party spotted
• Apes flank when possible, use cover from trees
• Flee individually at half HP (5-10 HP remaining)
• Brown Bear charges loudest threat, uses multiattack

**COMEDY MOMENT**:
When bear emerges from outhouse:
• Comedic beat as bear awkwardly pulls up guard pants
• Roars in embarrassment and charges
• Party can use this distraction (surprise round if they act fast)

**STEALTH APPROACH**:
• DC 13 Stealth to bypass sleeping apes
• DC 15 Stealth to enter tower unnoticed
• Advantage if party creates distraction (thrown rocks, animal sounds)
• Automatic success if party waits for apes to sleep (2+ hour wait)

**DIPLOMATIC APPROACH**:
• DC 16 Persuasion to convince guards party is here on Noke's business
• DC 14 Intimidation after downing 2 enemies causes surrender
• Bribe: 200 gp total convinces guards to "take a break"
• Guards know: Noke in main chamber, wand always on him, bed is "weird"

**ALTERNATE RESOLUTIONS**:
• **Disguise**: Polymorphed party members might blend in (DC 15 Deception)
• **Distraction**: Set fire to outhouse, guards investigate
• **Wait**: Guards rotate shifts every 4 hours, vulnerabilities change

**TREASURE**:
• 3 iron greatswords (50 gp each, oversized for Medium creatures)
• 25 gp scattered among dice game
• Guard uniforms (useful for disguise)

**ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES**:
• Trees provide half cover
• Elevated garden platform gives high ground advantage
• Outhouse can be tipped over (DC 12 STR) to trap bear inside temporarily

**IF NOKE ALERTED**:
If combat is loud or prolonged:
• Noke casts Enlarge on brown bear from window (AC 11, HP 51, +2 to hit, +1d4 damage)
• Casts Levitate on one PC to remove them from fight
• Prepares True Polymorph for when party enters tower

**PACING**: 15-25 minutes if full combat, 5-10 minutes if bypassed creatively.

**REWARDS FOR CREATIVITY**:
Award Inspiration or bonus XP for:
• Complete stealth bypass (100 bonus XP)
• Non-lethal takedowns of all guards (50 bonus XP each)
• Creative use of environment (burning outhouse, tipping platform, etc.)]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[**CLIMACTIC COMBAT**: Final confrontation with Noke and his Bed Dragon Wyrmling

**ENCOUNTER OVERVIEW**:
Noke, cornered in his bedroom, casts True Polymorph on his large wooden bed, transforming it into a Bed Dragon Wyrmling. The dragon appears carved from wood with billowing bedsheet wings and pillow tail. Noke rides the wyrmling, bursting through the ceiling to attack.

**COMBAT START**:
Three rounds after Noke flees to bedroom, loud crash from above. Chunks of wood fall as Noke and Bed Dragon burst through ceiling/roof. If party in main living area, dragon crashes through ceiling directly.

**NOKE'S TACTICS**:
• Stays mounted on dragon using Dagger only for self-defense
• Casts Ray of Frost to slow fleeing party members
• Uses Levitate to remove dangerous melee threats
• Maintains concentration on Enlarge/Reduce if bear still active
• If reduced below 15 HP, attempts to use wand on himself (malfunction)

**BED DRAGON TACTICS**:
• Not intelligent—acts on instinct
• Uses Splinter Breath on recharge as often as possible
• Attacks closest target when breath unavailable
• Prioritizes fire-users (vulnerable to fire damage)
• If Noke falls off (DC 15 DEX save when hit), dragon becomes confused—attacks randomly

**WAND MALFUNCTION**:
If Noke attempts to use wand on himself (desperate last resort):
• Wand crackles, fizzes, and explodes with loud bang
• Noke transforms into Gibbering Mouther (MM p157)
• Attacks mindlessly until destroyed
• Sad/tragic end to embittered apprentice

**ENVIRONMENT**:
• Bedroom chamber: 30 ft × 30 ft
• Ceiling 20 ft high (now broken open)
• Wardrobe and dressing table provide half cover
• Debris from ceiling creates difficult terrain
• If fought in main chamber: bookshelves, worktables, alchemical ingredients (flammable)

**IF DRAGON CONCENTRATION BROKEN**:
Dragon reverts to thoroughly beaten-up old bed. Noke falls prone, vulnerable.

**AFTERMATH**:
Recovering the Wand of True Polymorph requires decision:
• Use on Shinebright (risk malfunction)
• Stabilize wand first (requires expert artificer, 1,000 gp, 1 week)
• Destroy wand (safest option, Shinebright stays sheep)

**TREASURE**:
• Modified Wand of True Polymorph (1d4-1 charges, resets at dawn)
• Noke's spellbook (contains Enlarge/Reduce, Polymorph, Levitate, Haste)
• 250 gp in various coins
• Alchemical components worth 150 gp
• Shinebright's old robes (if restored, worth 100 gp)

**MORAL COMPLEXITY**:
Noke is victim and villain:
• Decades of mistreatment by Shinebright
• Snapped and committed evil act
• Guilt and paranoia destroyed his sanity
• Party can feel sympathy even while stopping him

**TIMING**: 30-40 minutes for full encounter]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Noke's Last Stand</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Climactic battle with emotional weight, showcase consequences of magical instability, provide moral complexity.

**DIFFICULTY**: Hard for level 3 party, Deadly for level 2. CR 6 + CR 4 = 1,400 XP total (2,800 adjusted for multiple enemies).

**DRAMATIC ENTRANCE**:
Give this moment cinematic weight:
• Describe creaking, groaning ceiling
• Dust and splinters rain down
• Sudden explosion of wood as dragon bursts through
• Noke wild-eyed, riding dragon, wand sparking dangerously

**NOKE'S MENTAL STATE**:
• Paranoid, desperate, barely coherent
• Shouts accusations at Shinebright (if visible): "You made me this! Decades wasted!"
• Pleads with party: "You don't understand—he used me, discarded me!"
• Becomes more unhinged as combat progresses
• Final words before wand malfunction: "If I can't have my due, I'll become UNSTOPPABLE!"

**MOUNTED COMBAT**:
• Noke has advantage on melee attacks against unmounted creatures
• If Noke takes damage, DC 15 DEX save or falls prone next to dragon
• Falling deal 1d6 damage, Noke loses concentration on any spells
• Unmounted Noke attempts to flee using Expeditious Retreat

**BED DRAGON BEHAVIOR**:
• Low intelligence (INT 8)—simple instincts
• Targets closest threat unless commanded otherwise
• Recharges breath weapon: Roll d6 at start of Noke's turn, recharges on 5-6
• If concentrating on breath weapon sound, dragon inhales visibly (telegraph attack)
• Wooden body creaks and groans when damaged

**FIRE VULNERABILITY**:
Bed Dragon takes DOUBLE damage from fire:
• Torch: 1d4 → 2d4 fire damage
• Burning Hands: 3d6 → 6d6 fire damage
• Fire catches—dragon takes additional 1d6 fire damage each round until extinguished
• Dragon panics when on fire—attacks wildly, may crash through walls

**WAND MALFUNCTION SEQUENCE**:
If Noke attempts desperate wand use:
1. Noke raises wand with trembling hand
2. Wand sparks, crackles with unstable magic
3. DC 17 Arcana check to stabilize (players can attempt to counterspell/interfere)
4. On failure: Loud BANG, flash of sickly green light
5. Noke transforms into Gibbering Mouther
6. Mouther babbles incoherently, attacks nearest creature
7. Sad, pathetic end to once-promising wizard

**WAND DAMAGE**:
If players attack wand specifically:
• Wand has AC 12, 10 HP
• Destroying wand while Noke holds it: He takes 4d6 force damage
• Destroyed wand cannot restore Shinebright

**TACTICAL COMPLICATIONS**:
Round 3: If Noke still alive, casts Haste on Bed Dragon:
• Dragon gets extra action each turn
• +2 AC (18 total)
• Advantage on DEX saves
• Speed doubled (60 ft ground/climb, 60 ft fly)

Round 5: Ceiling fully collapses (DEX DC 13 or take 2d6 bludgeoning)

**ENDING THE FIGHT**:
• If Bed Dragon reaches 0 HP: Reverts to broken bed, Noke falls
• If Noke reaches 0 HP: Dragon continues 1 round then reverts (concentration breaks)
• If both reduced to low HP: Noke attempts wand use (malfunction)

**ALTERNATE ENDINGS**:
• **Noke Captured**: Party can convince him to surrender (DC 18 Persuasion after reducing to <15 HP)
• **Noke Flees**: If escape route available, casts Expeditious Retreat and runs (chase scene)
• **Noke Redeems**: Extremely difficult (DC 20 Persuasion), but possible—helps party defeat dragon, begs forgiveness

**AFTERMATH DECISIONS**:
Party must decide Shinebright's fate with damaged wand:
1. **Risk It**: Cast True Polymorph now (17% chance malfunction kills Shinebright)
2. **Stabilize First**: Find artificer, spend 1,000 gp and 1 week (safe but slow)
3. **Leave as Sheep**: Shinebright stays sheep, wand destroyed (he's furious but alive)
4. **Seek Alternative**: Find more powerful caster (9th level spell needed)

**MORAL WEIGHT**:
This fight should feel TRAGIC, not triumphant:
• Noke was victim before becoming villain
• Shinebright's arrogance created this situation
• Modified wand represents hubris and desperation
• No clear "good guy" here—just flawed people making mistakes

**PACING**: 30-40 minutes. Keep tension high with environmental hazards, tactical escalation, and Noke's deteriorating sanity.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONCLUSION**: What happens after Noke is defeated

After the battle with Noke and the Bed Dragon concludes, party faces critical decisions about Shinebright's fate and the damaged wand. This is where player choices have lasting consequences.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE DAMAGED WAND**:

When party recovers the Wand of True Polymorph:

**Inspection Reveals**:
Anyone proficient in Arcana immediately notices:
• Wand has been heavily modified
• Bulbous, rune-inscribed iron band fitted to twig
• Deep cracks running along length
• Sparks unnaturally when touched
• Modified to cast more often, but rendered EXTREMELY unreliable

**DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check** reveals full danger:
• Each casting requires DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check
• Success: Spell works normally, DC permanently increases by 1
• Failure (miss by 5 or less): Target transforms into **Gibbering Mouther** instead (cannot be undone by spell lower than 9th level)
• Critical Failure (miss by 6+): Wand EXPLODES, deals 1d12 force damage per remaining charge to all within 10 feet, wand destroyed

**WAND PROPERTIES** (if inspected):
• Made from long, thin oak twig
• Holds 1d4-1 charges (minimum 1) of True Polymorph
• Resets at dawn each day
• Requires 1 hour attunement
• Anyone with spellcasting ability can use
• Modifications make it dangerous

**WAND'S HISTORY** (if party investigates):
Noke modified Shinebright's wand to increase charges. Overuse degraded wand's integrity. Now it's barely functional and potentially lethal.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SPEAKING WITH SHINEBRIGHT**:

If party searches central platform tower:

*"Among Noke's belongings, you find another Scroll of Speak with Animals. Shinebright the sheep bleats insistently, clearly wanting to communicate."*

When scroll is used, read:

*"The sheep's bleating morphs into cultured, elven-accented Common—though still with hints of bleat in the pronunciation.*

*Shinebright looks down at Noke's corpse (or transformed form) and his tone becomes somber.*

*'I... I did this to him. Decades ago, I took on a promising apprentice. He was brilliant, eager, loyal. And I used him. I took credit for his work, pushed him to dangerous experiments, discarded him when he made a mistake. He deserved better.'*

*The sheep shakes its head sadly.*

*'But that wand—it can restore me. I can feel it. Will you... will you use it to turn me back?'"*

**SHINEBRIGHT'S REALIZATION**:
For the first time, Shinebright demonstrates self-awareness:
• Recognizes how poorly he treated Noke
• Understands his arrogance created this situation  
• Shows genuine remorse (though fleeting)
• Still wants to be restored (selfish desire persists)

**SHINEBRIGHT'S REQUEST**:
Even when informed of wand's dangers, Shinebright is willing to risk death:
• "I'd rather die as myself than live as a sheep."
• "Please. I'll take the risk. Cast the spell."
• "What kind of existence is this? I need my hands, my magic, my MIND!"

**PERSUADING SHINEBRIGHT** (Optional):
If party tries to talk him out of risky spell:

**DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check**:
• Success: Shinebright reluctantly agrees to wait for safer restoration method
• Failure: Shinebright insists on immediate casting, guilt-trips party ("You'd condemn me to this?")

**Compelling Arguments** (grant advantage):
• "Noke died because of reckless magic. Don't repeat his mistake."
• "We can find a safer way. Give us time."
• "Your apprentice would want you to live, not gamble everything."
• "Think about your legacy. Don't let hubris kill you."

**SHINEBRIGHT'S FINAL WORDS** (before spell):
If party agrees to cast spell despite danger:

*"If I die... send word to my old college. Tell them... tell them I'm sorry. For everything."*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DECISION POINT**: Party Must Choose

Present players with clear options:

**OPTION 1: CAST SPELL NOW** (High Risk, High Reward)
• Use damaged wand immediately
• Caster makes DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check
• Success: Shinebright restored to elf form
• Failure (5 or less): Shinebright becomes Gibbering Mouther permanently  
• Critical Failure (6+): Shinebright dies, wand explodes

**OPTION 2: STABILIZE WAND FIRST** (Safe but Expensive)
• Find skilled artificer or wizard
• Cost: 1,000 gp materials + 1 week labor
• Guaranteed safe restoration afterward
• Shinebright must remain sheep during process

**OPTION 3: LEAVE AS SHEEP** (Safe but Unsatisfying)
• Destroy damaged wand (prevent future accidents)
• Shinebright remains sheep indefinitely
• He's furious but alive
• May find alternative solution later

**OPTION 4: SEEK ALTERNATIVE RESTORATION** (Quest Hook)
• Find 9th-level caster capable of True Polymorph or Wish
• Expensive, rare, requires connections
• Shinebright travels with party as sheep
• Adventure continues elsewhere

Let players discuss and decide. No "correct" answer—just consequences.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONSEQUENCE 1**: Spell Succeeds

If party casts spell and caster succeeds DC 17 Arcana check:

*"The wand sparks and hums with unstable energy. For a terrifying moment, it seems like it will explode—but then the magic stabilizes. Brilliant light engulfs the sheep, and when it fades, Shinebright stands before you.*

*He's a high elf again—tall, dignified, with silver hair and elegant features. He stretches his fingers, conjures a small flame in his palm, and laughs with pure relief.*

*'I'm BACK! Oh, thank the gods, I'm myself again!'"*

**SHINEBRIGHT'S GRATITUDE** (Once Reminded):
Shinebright must be reminded of any promises made while sheep:
• "Oh. Yes. Right. Rewards. Hmm."
• "I'm afraid Noke was virtually bankrupt. He sold everything to fund his research and hire guards."
• "I cannot pay you in gold. But I can offer something better."

**SHINEBRIGHT'S REWARD OFFER**:
• **Transmutation Services**: Will perform any transmutation spell up to 5th level
• **Cost**: Component costs only (no service fee)
• **Available Spells**: Alter Self, Enlarge/Reduce, Gaseous Form, Polymorph, Telekinesis, Transmute Rock
• **Ongoing Benefit**: Can be called upon for future transmutation needs
• **Additional Service**: Takes in any polymorphed guards who fled, promises to restore them to natural forms over time

**TOWER OWNERSHIP** (Optional):
If party wishes, they can claim Noke's tower as base of operations:
• Magically constructed from living oak trees
• Multiple platforms connected by wooden stairs
• Worth approximately 1,000 gp if sold/dismantled
• Contains arcane laboratory (transmutation focus)
• WARNING: Local nobles may visit looking for Noke—party must explain situation

**XP REWARD**: 500 XP per party member for completing adventure

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONSEQUENCE 2**: Spell Fails (Gibbering Mouther)

If caster fails DC 17 check by 5 or less:

*"The wand sparks violently. The magic twists, warps, becomes something WRONG. The sheep's form bubbles and distorts sickeningly. Limbs sprout at random angles. Organs push through skin. Faces—dozens of broken, screaming faces—emerge across its surface.*

*What stands before you is a Gibbering Mouther—a hideous mass of randomly-assembled body parts, babbling in countless broken voices. Among the babble, you can just make out fragments of Shinebright's cultured accent, now twisted into incoherent madness.*

*The thing that was Shinebright lunges at the nearest creature, attacking mindlessly."*

**IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES**:
• Shinebright permanently transformed into Gibbering Mouther (MM p157)
• Cannot be reversed by any spell lower than 9th level
• Mouther attacks nearest creature indiscriminately
• Party must defeat or restrain former ally
• Tragic, horrifying end to once-great wizard

**AFTERMATH OPTIONS**:
• Kill Gibbering Mouther (mercy killing—Shinebright is gone)
• Restrain and contain it (seek 9th-level caster for cure—expensive quest)
• Release into wilderness (cruel but avoids difficult choice)

**TOWER LOOTING**:
Party is free to honor Shinebright's final wish (contact college) or loot tower:
• Lab equipment worth ~1,000 gp (expensive arcane paraphernalia)
• Empty of valuables useful to non-transmuters
• Can claim entire tower complex as own (see Option 1 consequences for details)

**XP REWARD**: 500 XP per party member (completed adventure, despite tragic ending)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONSEQUENCE 3**: Spell Fails Critically (Wand Explodes)

If caster fails DC 17 check by 6 or more:

*"The wand's cracks glow with sickly green light. The runes on the iron band flare brilliant white. You have half a second to realize what's about to happen.*

*BOOM.*

*The wand detonates in a massive explosion of force energy. The blast wave throws you backward as shrapnel tears through the air. When the dust settles, the wand is gone—vaporized. And where Shinebright stood...*

*Nothing. Not even ash."*

**IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES**:
• Shinebright DEAD permanently (disintegrated, no body to resurrect)
• Wand completely destroyed
• All creatures within 10 feet take **1d12 force damage per remaining charge** (typically 1-3 charges = 1d12 to 3d12)
• DEX save DC 15 for half damage

**AFTERMATH**:
• Party can honor final wish (notify college of death)
• Tower available to loot or claim
• Tragic ending—hubris killed Shinebright as it killed Noke
• Poetic justice: Wand that caused Noke's downfall caused Shinebright's death

**XP REWARD**: 500 XP per party member (adventure complete, lesson learned about magical hubris)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONSEQUENCE 4**: Party Refuses to Cast Spell

If party declines to use damaged wand:

*"Shinebright's woolly face falls. 'I... I understand. You're right. It's too dangerous.' He looks down at his hooved feet and sighs—a deeply human sound from a sheep.*

*'I won't give up hope. I'll take back my old tower, set up my lab again, and work toward finding a safe way to reverse this curse. It may take years. But I'll find a way.'*

*He looks up at you, gratitude mixing with disappointment in his eyes.*

*'I owe you my life. Even if I'm still a sheep, I'm alive because of you. That debt won't be forgotten.'"*

**SHINEBRIGHT'S NEXT STEPS**:
• Claims Noke's tower as own (it was his originally)
• Goes to bedroom, puts on one of his old robes (wears it as sheep)
• Sets up laboratory to research safe restoration
• Bitter and frustrated, but acknowledges debt to party
• May take years to find solution, but won't stop trying

**SHINEBRIGHT'S GRATITUDE** (Reluctant):
Though upset, Shinebright acknowledges large debt:
• "When I'm restored—and I WILL be restored—I won't forget what you did."
• "You saved my life. Twice, really. Once from Noke, once from my own recklessness."
• "If you ever need transmutation magic, come find me. I'll help however I can."

**FUTURE ALLIANCE**:
Shinebright becomes recurring NPC:
• Researching restoration (quest hook: gather rare components)
• Offers advice and magical assistance
• Slowly becomes more humble (life as sheep teaches lessons)
• Eventually restored through safer means (future adventure)

**XP REWARD**: 500 XP per party member (wisdom in restraint rewarded)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TOWER DETAILS** (For Options Where Tower Available):

**Noke's Tower Complex**:
• Magically constructed from living oak trees
• Central platform with laboratory, dining area, lounge
• Bedroom platform connected by wooden walkway
• Courtyard with garden, large tree, wooden bridges
• Two rectangular outbuildings (guard barracks)
• Square outbuilding (storage/study)
• Fenced compound with worn dirt paths
• Worth approximately 1,000 gp materials if dismantled

**Taking Ownership**:
Party can claim tower if Shinebright dies or leaves:
• Functional arcane laboratory (transmutation focus)
• Living quarters for 4-6 people
• Defensible position (elevated platforms)
• Magical construction (self-repairing to degree)

**WARNING**:
Local nobles occasionally visited Noke. When they return and find him missing (or dead), party must explain:
• Option: Tell truth (Noke attacked them, died in combat)
• Option: Claim Noke sold tower before leaving area
• Option: Present tower as salvage/abandoned property
• Potential complications: Nobles want investigation, inheritance claims, magical property disputes

**Lab Equipment** (If Looting):
Expensive transmutation-focused tools and materials:
• Alembics, retorts, crystalline lenses
• Rune-inscribed focusing implements
• Rare transmutation reagents
• Arcane reference books
• Total value: ~1,000 gp (must find buyer—specialized equipment)

Useless to non-transmuters for practical purposes, but valuable to collectors or mage academies.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM GUIDANCE**: Running the Aftermath

**TONE**:
This should feel BITTERSWEET, not triumphant:
• Party defeated villain but situation is messy
• No clean "happily ever after"—just complicated people making choices
• Magical hubris has consequences (Noke, Shinebright, wand)
• Player choices matter—different endings have different impacts

**LETTING PLAYERS DECIDE**:
Do NOT push party toward specific choice:
• Present options clearly and honestly
• Let them debate and discuss
• All outcomes are valid—just different consequences
• Don't punish "wrong" choice (there isn't one)

**INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY**:
Before party decides, ensure they know:
• Wand is extremely dangerous (DC 15 Arcana reveals specifics)
• What happens if spell fails (Gibbering Mouther or death)
• Alternative options exist (stabilization, alternative restoration)
• Shinebright is willing to risk death but can be persuaded otherwise

**FORESHADOWING**:
If party ignores warnings and rushes to cast spell:
• Wand sparks when touched (physical warning)
• Noke's corpse nearby (visual reminder of magical failure)
• Shinebright hesitates: "Are you sure? I can wait..." (last chance to reconsider)

**DICE ROLLS**:
If party chooses to cast spell:
• Roll DC 17 Arcana check openly (everyone sees result)
• Build tension: "The wand begins to glow... Make your Arcana check."
• Describe failure vividly (transformation or explosion)
• No take-backs—magic is dangerous, choices have weight

**ROLEPLAY SHINEBRIGHT**:
Sheep-Shinebright should be:
• Grateful but still somewhat arrogant
• Self-aware (briefly) about how he treated Noke
• Desperate to be restored (understandable desire)
• Willing to accept risk (speaks to character)
• Forgetful about promises (needs reminding—shows he hasn't completely changed)

**AFTERMATH RELATIONSHIPS**:
Depending on outcome:
• Success: Shinebright becomes recurring ally (transmutation services)
• Failure (Mouther): Tragic cautionary tale, quest hook to find cure
• Failure (Death): Poetic justice, lesson about hubris
• Refused: Shinebright respects wisdom, future alliance possible

**ADVENTURE COMPLETE**: 500 XP to each party member regardless of outcome

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THEMES AND LESSONS**:

This adventure reinforces campaign themes:
• **Magic is dangerous**: Even skilled wizards make catastrophic mistakes
• **Hubris has consequences**: Shinebright's arrogance created Noke's villainy
• **Power corrupts**: Noke's desperation led to crime and violence
• **Redemption is complicated**: No clean heroes or villains—just flawed people
• **Choices matter**: Player decisions create lasting consequences

The Aeorian Echo makes magic LESS stable. Artifacts malfunction. Spells fail unpredictably. This is early evidence of larger campaign problem.

**MORAL AMBIGUITY**:
There are NO pure heroes here:
• Shinebright: Arrogant, exploitative, selfish (but also victim of accident)
• Noke: Victim turned villain, sympathetic but dangerous (but also murderer and kidnapper)
• Party: Must make difficult choices with no clear "right" answer

**CONSEQUENCES RIPPLE OUTWARD**:
Depending on resolution:
• Shinebright restored → Transmutation services available
• Shinebright dead → One less powerful caster in world, cautionary tale spreads
• Shinebright as sheep → Ongoing quest to restore him, builds relationship
• Tower claimed → Base of operations, potential noble complications

**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 20-30 minutes for aftermath conversation and decision-making]]></text>

<note>
<name>Modified Wand Stats</name>
<text><![CDATA[**MODIFIED WAND OF TRUE POLYMORPH**

**Appearance**:
Long, thin twig taken from oak tree, fitted with bulbous rune-inscribed iron band. Deep cracks run along length.

**Properties**:
• Contains 1d4-1 charges (minimum 1) of True Polymorph
• Charges reset at dawn each day
• Requires 1 hour attunement
• Any creature with spellcasting ability can use
• Casting time, range, duration as True Polymorph spell

**DANGER - MODIFIED AND UNSTABLE**:

Each time charge is used, caster must make **DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check**:

**SUCCESS**: 
• Spell casts normally (as True Polymorph)
• DC permanently increases by +1 for future castings
• Wand deteriorates further (cosmetic—more cracks appear)

**FAILURE (miss by 5 or less)**:
• Target transforms into **Gibbering Mouther** (MM p157) instead of intended form
• Transformation cannot be undone by any spell lower than 9th level
• Cannot be cancelled by ending concentration (permanent until 9th-level spell cast)
• Target gets saving throw as normal True Polymorph
• Gibbering Mouther attacks nearest creature mindlessly

**CRITICAL FAILURE (miss by 6 or more)**:
• All consequences of regular failure PLUS:
• Wand EXPLODES violently
• All creatures within 10 feet take **1d12 force damage per remaining charge** (DEX save DC 15 for half)
• Wand completely destroyed (cannot be repaired)

**DETECTION**:

**DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check** reveals:
• Wand has been modified to cast more frequently
• Overuse has rendered it extremely unreliable
• Bulbous iron band is amateur artificing (increases charges but destabilizes magic)
• Cracks indicate structural magical damage
• Each use risks catastrophic failure

Anyone who touches wand notices it sparks unnaturally (obvious sign of instability).

**STABILIZATION**:

Wand can be stabilized by skilled artificer or transmutation specialist:
• Cost: 1,000 gp in rare materials
• Time: 1 week of intensive work
• DC 20 Arcana check to stabilize successfully
• If stabilized: Functions as normal Wand of True Polymorph (no checks required, 1d6-1 charges)

**DESTRUCTION**:

Wand can be deliberately destroyed:
• Prevents future accidents
• No explosion if destroyed carefully
• Ends any chance of using it to restore Shinebright

**HISTORY**:

Originally Shinebright's wand. Noke stole it, modified it to increase charges, overused it researching polymorph solutions. Degradation is result of amateur modifications and excessive casting. Represents magical hubris—trying to shortcut natural limitations of magic.]]></text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Pinebrook sits nestled at the base of the Spine of the World mountains—a small logging and mining settlement of weathered cabins and wood smoke. Captain Emmajeen Kole stands at the village edge, arms crossed, studying the tree line with concern. When she spots your group, relief flashes across her face.

"Thank the gods you're here," she says, turning to face you. "We have a situation. Yesterday, one of our patrols found troll tracks in the forest—large ones, heading toward the mountain. We haven't seen trolls down from the peaks in two months. Not since the silver dragon moved into the old ice caves. But now that patrol is overdue."

She gestures toward the dark forest beyond the village. "I need you to follow their route, find out what happened, and assess the threat. If trolls are coming back, we need to know why—and how many."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INVESTIGATION ENCOUNTER**: Discovering evidence of ice troll activity

**LOCATION**: Forest trails around Pinebrook village

**TRIGGER**: Party arrives in Pinebrook or is recruited for patrol duty

**SITUATION**:
Pinebrook is small logging/mining settlement at base of Spine of the World mountains. Recent weeks have brought concerning changes:
• Friendly silver dragon reportedly established lair in nearby mountain (2 months ago)
• Hostile creatures (ice trolls, winter wolves) haven't been seen since dragon arrived
• **Yesterday**: Patrol discovered large, frosty troll footprints in forest
• **This morning**: That patrol hasn't returned

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CAPTAIN EMMAJEEN KOLE** (Quest Giver):
• Female human, mid-30s, Captain of Pinebrook Guard
• AC 16 (chain shirt + shield), HP 32, Veteran stats
• Pragmatic, protective of villagers, nervous about recent events
• Carries *The Practically Complete Guide to Dragons* in backpack

**Kole's Briefing**:
"Yesterday's patrol found troll tracks—big ones, heading toward the mountain. But trolls haven't come down from the peaks in two months. Not since the silver dragon moved in. Now that patrol is overdue. I need you to follow their route, find out what happened, and assess the threat. If there are trolls, we need to know how many and what they're after."

**Optional Roleplaying**:
Before patrol, Kole asks party to introduce themselves. Allows character bonding and establishes relationships.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INVESTIGATION PHASE**:

**LOCATION 1: Village Edge** (Starting Point)
Party begins where yesterday's patrol entered forest. Fresh tracks visible:
• 4 sets of humanoid boots (patrol members)
• Large, three-toed prints in frost (ice troll—DC 10 Nature to identify)
• Tracks lead northeast toward mountain

**DC 12 Survival** (tracking): Notice tracks are ~24 hours old. Patrol followed troll deliberately.

**DC 14 Perception**: Find crushed winterberries along trail—patrol stopped to gather food/evidence.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION 2: Midpoint Clearing** (15 minutes into forest)
Small clearing with evidence of struggle:

**Automatic Discovery**:
• Scorch marks on trees (acid damage)
• Broken spear (Pinebrook Guard issue)
• Blood in snow (human and something else)

**DC 13 Investigation**:
• Blood trail leads northeast (continues toward mountain)
• Spear was broken by immense strength (troll)
• Acid burns suggest ice troll spit (they expectorate freezing acid as ranged attack)

**DC 15 Survival**:
• Patrol fought here but wasn't overwhelmed—only one injury
• Tracks show they continued northeast AFTER fight (chasing troll?)
• Additional tracks: something smaller, hopping gait (frog-like, 3-4 creatures)

**DC 10 Perception** (examining trees):
• Deep claw marks 8 feet up tree trunk
• Fresh—made within last 12 hours
• Suggests large creature(s) passed through after fight

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION 3: Frozen Stream** (30 minutes into forest)
Stream partially frozen, unusual for season:

**Automatic Discovery**:
• More troll tracks crossing stream
• 4 sets of boot prints following
• New tracks: massive webbed feet (egg snatcher—party doesn't know this yet)

**DC 14 Arcana or Nature**:
• Stream shouldn't be frozen this solidly in current season
• Magic is involved—cold-based transmutation or environmental manipulation
• Consistent with ice troll presence OR draconic cold aura

**DC 12 Survival** (examining stream bank):
• Egg snatchers emerged FROM stream (amphibious)
• Webbed tracks indicate horse-sized frog-like creatures
• Tracks parallel troll tracks toward mountain

**Evidence Found**:
• Patrol member's waterskin (dropped in haste)
• Inside: Note in Kole's handwriting: "Follow to source. Report back by sundown. Do NOT engage alone."

**DC 10 Insight**: Patrol disobeyed orders—went too far, too fast.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LOCATION 4: Ambush Site** (45 minutes into forest, approaching mountain base)
Site of patrol's last stand:

**Automatic Discovery**:
• Massive signs of combat
• All 4 patrol members' weapons scattered (2 spears, 1 sword, 1 crossbow)
• Large quantities of blood (mostly human)
• Drag marks leading up mountain trail

**DC 15 Medicine**:
• Blood loss suggests serious injuries but not immediately fatal
• Patrol members were dragged away alive (for what purpose?)
• No troll blood—they fought egg snatchers, not trolls

**DC 16 Investigation**:
• Combat occurred ~6 hours ago (early this morning)
• Egg snatchers ambushed patrol from above (dropped from trees)
• Patrol was overwhelmed quickly—no chance to flee
• Drag marks lead toward mountain cave system

**DC 13 Perception** (searching area):
• Find torn piece of parchment caught on bramble
• Writing in Draconic script (if party has translator or speaks Draconic):
  - Partial training command: "...bring eggs to... cold ones reward... teeth sharp for..."
• Suggests egg snatchers are trained creatures serving ice trolls

**Evidence Found**:
• Patrol sergeant's badge (bloodstained)
• Can return to Kole as proof patrol was found
• Returning now = tactical retreat, no resolution (patrol possibly still alive)
• Continuing = risk party's lives to attempt rescue

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DECISION POINT**:

Party must choose:

**Option 1: Return to Pinebrook Immediately**
• Report findings to Captain Kole
• She organizes larger rescue party (takes 2 hours)
• By then, patrol members' fate is sealed (captured, taken to troll lair)
• **Consequence**: No patrol rescue possible, but party conserves resources

**Option 2: Pursue Immediately**
• Follow drag marks toward mountain
• Attempt rescue before patrol moved deeper into troll territory
• High risk but patrol might still be saved
• **Consequence**: Party commits to danger, potential combat with egg snatchers

**Option 3: Split Party** (if 5+ players)
• Send 1-2 back to report, rest pursue
• Reinforcements arrive late but party has backup incoming
• **Consequence**: Smaller party faces danger, but help is coming

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INFORMATION GATHERED**:

By end of investigation, party knows:
1. **Ice trolls** are active again despite silver dragon's presence
2. **Egg snatchers** (unknown creatures) are working for trolls
3. **Missing patrol** was ambushed and captured alive ~6 hours ago
4. **Troll target** is likely the silver dragon's lair (egg theft)
5. **Urgency** is critical—patrol and dragon eggs both at risk

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**XP REWARD**: 200 XP (divided amongst party) for successful investigation

**TIME**: 30-45 minutes

**TRANSITION**:
• If party returns to Pinebrook: Kole thanks them, prepares militia, sends them back with reinforcements
• If party pursues: Leads directly to dragon lair/egg snatcher encounters
• In either case, party is now aware of the threat and motivated to act

**SCALING**:
• Younger players: Remove Option 3, simplify clue descriptions
• Experienced players: Add time pressure (sounds of combat in distance = patrol still fighting)
• Larger parties: Add additional clue locations for more investigation depth]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Pinebrook Investigation</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Build tension through investigation. Teach tracking, evidence-gathering, decision-making under pressure.

**PACING**: Don't rush. Let players examine each location, discuss theories, debate next steps.

**CLUE PROGRESSION**:
- Location 1: "Something is wrong" (troll tracks)
- Location 2: "Patrol fought something" (struggle evidence)
- Location 3: "Multiple threats present" (egg snatchers introduced)
- Location 4: "Patrol captured, time is critical" (decision point)

**SKILL CHECK PHILOSOPHY**:
Failed checks don't stop progress—party still finds patrol's trail. Success provides ADDITIONAL information that helps with planning.

**DECISION POINT HANDLING**:
Don't judge party's choice:
• Retreat = smart, tactical
• Pursue = heroic, risky
• Split = creative compromise

All choices have consequences. Reward thoughtful decision-making.

**MISSING PATROL FATE** (DM decides based on party choice):
• Immediate pursuit: 1d3 patrol members rescued alive
• Delayed pursuit (return first): All patrol members captured, can be found in troll lair later
• No pursuit: Patrol members become troll prisoners (future plot hook)

**TROLL HINTS**:
Don't reveal trolls directly—build dread through evidence:
• Massive strength (broken spear)
• Acid attacks (scorch marks)
• Size (8-foot claw marks)
• Cold magic (frozen stream)

Trolls themselves don't appear in THIS encounter—save for later.

**EGG SNATCHER FORESHADOWING**:
Webbed tracks, hopping gait, amphibious nature—players won't know what these are yet. Creates mystery. When they encounter egg snatchers later, they'll remember the tracks.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The trail winds upward through dense pine forest, the snow-capped mountain looming larger with each step. Frost clings to every branch, and your breath mists in the cold air. Captain Kole walks ahead, one hand resting on her sword hilt, the other clutching her well-worn dragon manual.

Suddenly, she stops and raises her hand. "Do you hear that?" she whispers.

From somewhere in the bushes ahead comes a sound—soft and pitiful, like a kitten mewling in distress. It's coming from beneath a thornbush just off the trail.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ENCOUNTER**: Finding and caring for lost silver dragon wyrmling

**LOCATION**: Forest trail approaching mountain base

**TRIGGER**: After investigating troll tracks, party continues toward mountain

**DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check:
• **Success**: Character hears soft mewling sound, like distressed kitten, coming from bushes ahead
• **Failure**: Kole points toward sound, indicates party should investigate

**Investigating the Sound**:
In small hollow beneath thornbush, party finds:

**BABY SILVER DRAGON WYRMLING**:
• Size of large housecat
• Silver scales dull, not shiny (malnourished)
• Wings folded against body, shivering
• Eyes half-closed, weak
• Mewling softly in distress

**AUTOMATIC OBSERVATION**:
This is clearly a very young dragon—newborn or only days old. It's alone, cold, and appears to have been separated from its mother for some time (at least 12-24 hours based on weakness).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INVESTIGATION PHASE**:

Party can examine dragon and surroundings:

**DC 10 Nature or Arcana** (identifying dragon):
• Definitely silver dragon wyrmling (metallic dragon, good-aligned)
• Newborn—less than a week old
• Should be with mother in lair
• Separation this young is dangerous—wyrmlings need constant care

**DC 12 Medicine** (examining dragon):
• Dehydrated and hungry
• Minor scratches and bruises (carried roughly, then dropped?)
• No serious injuries
• Needs food and water immediately or will weaken further

**DC 13 Survival** (examining tracks around hollow):
• Egg snatcher webbed tracks lead TO this spot from direction of mountain
• Tracks show creature SET dragon down (didn't drop accidentally)
• Then tracks lead back toward mountain—creature returned to lair
• Suggests egg snatcher was transporting wyrmling, was interrupted or lost it

**DC 14 Investigation** (examining hollow):
• Dragon has been here 6-8 hours (based on disturbed earth, melted frost from body heat)
• Small pile of chewed pine needles—dragon tried to eat vegetation (can't digest it)
• Shallow scrapes in dirt—dragon tried to burrow for warmth

**DC 15 Insight** (watching dragon's behavior):
• When party approaches, dragon doesn't flee or attack
• It watches them with intelligent eyes—understands they might help
• Occasionally tries to vocalize but too weak
• This is clear cry for help

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CAPTAIN KOLE'S REACTION**:

If party seems confused or hesitant, Kole provides guidance:

*"By the gods... that's a baby silver dragon. The rumors were true—a silver dragon really did establish a lair here! But how did this little one get so far from home?"*

Kole pulls *The Practically Complete Guide to Dragons* from backpack, flips to middle:

*"Listen to this: 'Silver dragons are among the noblest of metallic dragons. They value courage, honor, and protection of the innocent. A mother silver dragon is fiercely protective of her young and will never abandon them willingly.' This baby must have been taken from the lair. The egg snatchers—they're stealing dragon eggs!"*

**Kole's Deduction**:
• Ice trolls sent egg snatchers to steal silver dragon eggs
• This wyrmling hatched recently, was being transported
• Either it escaped or was dropped during troll/egg snatcher conflict
• Mother dragon doesn't know where baby is—lair is miles away
• Patrol that went missing likely stumbled onto egg snatcher operation

**Kole's Orders**:
*"I must return to Pinebrook immediately and report this. We need to prepare defenses in case the trolls attack the village. But this baby needs to get back to its mother NOW. I'm ordering you to take this wyrmling up the mountain to the silver dragon's lair. Protect it with your lives. Silver dragons are our friends—if we return her child, she'll help us against the trolls."*

**Kole provides**:
• Page torn from dragon book: Draconic language translations (Common to Draconic)
• Her rations (for dragon)
• Rough map to mountain lair entrance (marks trail)
• Pinebrook Guard badge (identifies them as official patrol)

Then Kole hurries back toward village.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CARING FOR THE WYRMLING**:

Party must now care for dragon. Several checks possible:

**FEEDING**:
Dragon is hungry. Party can:

**Option 1: Offer Rations** (automatic success)
• Party members have rations listed on character sheets
• Dragon eagerly eats dried meat, cheese
• Regains some strength (HP increases by 1d4 if using stats)

**Option 2: Forage for Food**
• **DC 10 Survival** (Shalefire-type ranger): Find berries, nuts dragon can eat
• **DC 10 Nature** (Gallantine-type druid): Know what foods are safe for wyrmlings
• Success: Dragon eats, regains strength

**WARMING**:
Dragon is cold. Party can:
• Wrap in cloak or blanket (automatic success)
• Build small fire (DC 10 Survival)
• Cast warming magic if available
• Let dragon ride in warm backpack

**BONDING**:
Party should name dragon. Encourage creativity:
• Traditional dragon names: Silvara, Argentum, Crystalwing
• Cute names: Frosty, Shimmer, Snowball
• Descriptive names: Lucky, Brave, Hope

**DC 10 Animal Handling** (bonding):
• Success: Dragon bonds with character, trusts them
• Dragon will follow that character, respond to simple commands
• Advantage on future interactions with mother dragon (showed kindness to wyrmling)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**WYRMLING STATS** (if needed for mechanics):

**Silver Dragon Wyrmling** (Non-Combatant):
• Tiny Dragon, Lawful Good
• AC 14 (natural armor), HP 8 (currently at 4/8), Speed 20 ft., fly 40 ft. (too weak to fly now)
• STR 6 (−2), DEX 12 (+1), CON 12 (+1), INT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 12 (+1)
• Skills: Perception +2
• Senses: darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12
• Languages: Draconic (understands but can't speak yet—too young)

**Abilities**:
• **Keen Senses**: Advantage on Perception checks
• **Cold Resistance**: Resistant to cold damage
• **Bond**: After being cared for, wyrmling becomes attached to party

**NOT COMBAT READY**: Wyrmling cannot fight. Will hide if combat occurs.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INFORMATION REVEALED**:

Through this encounter, party learns:
1. **Silver dragon lair** is in nearby mountain
2. **Egg snatchers** are stealing dragon eggs for ice trolls
3. **Mother dragon** doesn't know wyrmling is lost
4. **Urgency increased**—must return wyrmling AND stop egg theft
5. **Alliance opportunity**—helping silver dragon creates powerful ally

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**XP REWARD**: 100 XP (for successful care and bonding with wyrmling)

**TIME**: 15-20 minutes

**TRANSITION**:
Party now has:
• Baby dragon to protect (can't abandon it—moral imperative)
• Map to dragon lair
• Draconic language reference (useful later)
• Mission: Return wyrmling, stop egg theft, save patrol (if still pursuing that goal)

Proceed toward mountain lair. Next encounters: Living Icicles (cave entrance guardians), then deeper into lair where egg snatchers are active.

**SCALING**:
• **Younger players**: Simplify dragon care (just feed it, automatic success)
• **Roleplaying focus**: Encourage naming, talking to dragon, describing how they carry it
• **Combat focus**: Skip extensive care mechanics, dragon just follows party]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Baby Dragon Discovery</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Emotional hook. Create bond between party and dragon. Establish stakes.

**TONE**: This should be heartwarming moment before danger escalates. Baby dragon is adorable, helpless, trusts party.

**ROLEPLAYING OPPORTUNITIES**:
Encourage players to:
• Name the dragon together
• Decide who carries it
• Talk to it (even though it can't talk back yet)
• Protect it fiercely

**WHY THIS WORKS**:
Players who bond with baby dragon will fight harder to protect it AND to help mother dragon. Emotional investment drives engagement.

**CAPTAIN KOLE'S ROLE**:
Kole provides exposition efficiently then LEAVES. Don't let NPC overshadow party—they're the heroes, not her.

**DRACONIC LANGUAGE PAGE**:
This is Chekhov's Gun—give it to party now, they'll need it later for:
• Puzzle in dragon lair (speaking Draconic to open door)
• Communicating with mother dragon
• Understanding dragon signs/warnings

**WYRMLING BEHAVIOR**:
Dragon should be:
• Weak but trusting
• Occasionally makes soft chirping/mewling sounds
• Curls up against warmest party member
• Shows affection (nuzzles, gentle tail swish)
• Completely non-threatening

If players try to harm dragon (unlikely but possible):
• Kole intervenes before they succeed
• Dragon cries out—mother might hear (dangerous)
• Alignment implications (harming innocent babies is evil act)

**BONDING MECHANICS**:
Don't require perfect rolls—party WILL successfully care for dragon. Checks determine HOW WELL they do it, which affects:
• Dragon's current HP/condition
• Bonding strength (affects mother's reaction later)
• Party's confidence going forward

**TRANSITION NOTE**:
After this encounter, party has clear goal: Get to mountain lair. They're now emotionally invested in dragon's safety AND in stopping egg thieves.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The mountain trail ends at a massive cave opening—twenty feet wide and fifteen feet tall, framed by ancient ice and stone. Fresh snow is piled at the entrance, and a faint cold mist drifts from within. Deep claw marks, each as long as your forearm, score the rock around the entrance. This is unmistakably a dragon's lair.

The baby dragon in your arms stirs and chirps softly, its silver eyes fixed on the cave.

Then, movement. Five crystalline figures detach from the icy cave walls—humanoid shapes made entirely of jagged ice, their bodies glinting in the pale light. They have no faces, just sharp claws raised to strike. With silent, deliberate steps, they advance toward you.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Defending against ice troll guardians

**LOCATION**: Cave entrance at base of mountain

**TRIGGER**: Party approaches silver dragon's lair with baby wyrmling

**SITUATION**:
After discovering baby dragon and learning about egg snatcher threat, party follows mountain trail to dragon's lair. Cave entrance visible ahead—but guarded by magical creatures left by ice trolls.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CAVE APPROACH**:

Party sees large cave opening in mountainside:
• 20 feet wide, 15 feet tall
• Fresh snow piled at entrance
• Faint cold mist drifts from within
• Large claw marks around entrance (dragon-sized)

**DC 12 Perception** (approaching cave):
• Movement in shadows near entrance
• Glinting of ice in darkness
• Soft clicking sounds (ice shifting)

**DC 13 Arcana or Nature**:
• Magical aura emanates from cave
• Cold here is unnatural—colder than surrounding area
• Transmutation magic present (creatures made of ice)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT TRIGGER**:

As party reaches cave entrance, read:

*"Five crystalline figures detach from the icy cave walls. They're shaped like humanoids but made entirely of jagged ice—living icicles with sharp claws and no faces. They advance silently toward you, claws raised to strike."*

**LIVING ICICLES (5)**:
• Magical constructs created by ice trolls
• Guard cave entrance to prevent intruders
• Attack any warm-blooded creatures
• Shatter when destroyed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TERRAIN FEATURES**:

**Cave Entrance Area**:
• **Snow Drifts**: Difficult terrain, 5 ft deep in places
• **Ice Patches**: DC 10 Acrobatics or fall prone
• **Stalagmites**: Provide half cover, can be used to break line of sight
• **Rockfall**: Loose stones above entrance—can be triggered with ranged attack to drop on creatures (DC 12 DEX save or 2d6 bludgeoning)

**Light**:
• Bright sunlight outside cave
• Dim light just inside entrance
• Darkness deeper in cave

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LIVING ICICLE TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: Icicles spread out, attempt to surround party
**Round 2+**: Focus attacks on characters carrying baby dragon OR spellcasters
**Below Half HP**: Icicle becomes erratic—attacks randomly, loses strategic thinking
**0 HP**: Shatters into ice shards (describe dramatically)

**Special Behavior**:
• Silent—no vocalization
• Immune to cold damage (made of ice)
• Vulnerable to fire damage (takes double damage from fire)
• Can move through narrow spaces (2-inch gaps) by becoming liquid briefly

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**BABY DRAGON DURING COMBAT**:

Wyrmling clings to party member carrying it:
• Whimpers when icicles approach
• Attempts to breathe tiny frost puff (does nothing—too young)
• If carrier drops to 0 HP, dragon falls and mewls loudly (alerts mother dragon inside lair—future consequence)

**Optional**: At DM's discretion, if party is struggling, baby dragon can exhale tiny Cold Breath (once only):
• 15-foot cone
• 1d6 cold damage
• DC 10 DEX save for half
• Dragon exhausted after—must rest

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**AFTERMATH**:

Once all living icicles destroyed:

**Searching Area**:
• Worn leather backpack near cave wall (left by previous adventurers)
• Contains: dried meat rations (5), torches (5), flint & steel, small pouch with 12 gp
• Broken spear (Pinebrook Guard issue)—evidence of earlier patrol

**Cave Entrance Clear**:
Party can now safely enter dragon's lair. Cave tunnel slopes upward into mountain. Baby dragon becomes more animated—knows it's close to home.

**DC 10 History or Religion** (examining cave walls):
• Chalk drawings of troll-like figures
• Ancient—ice trolls lived here long ago
• Dragon recently claimed lair (trolls evicted)
• Icicle guardians left behind when trolls fled

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRANSITION**:

Cave tunnel leads deeper into mountain:
• Upward-sloping passage
• Walls covered in frost
• Dragon chirps encouragingly—recognizes scent of lair
• Next challenge: Navigating dangerous cave system to reach hatching chamber

**DM NOTE**: Party now inside dragon's mountain lair. Living icicles were outer defense. Deeper challenges await (ice mirror puzzle, dangerous slides) before reaching hatching chamber where egg snatchers threaten remaining eggs.]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Living Icicles Combat</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: First real combat of Pinebrook adventure. Test party's abilities, introduce terrain mechanics, establish threat level.

**DIFFICULTY**: Manageable for level 1-2 party. Five CR 1/4 creatures = 125 XP total.

**TACTICAL NOTES**:
• Icicles are CONSTRUCTS—no fear, no mercy, no morale checks
• Surround party if possible (use superior numbers)
• Focus fire on vulnerable targets (low AC characters, baby dragon carrier)
• Vulnerable to fire—smart players will exploit this

**SCALING**:
• 3 players: Remove 1 icicle
• 2 players: Remove 2 icicles
• Party struggling: Have 1-2 icicles shatter spontaneously (unstable magic)
• Party dominating: Have icicles reform after shattering (once only, +7 HP)

**ENVIRONMENTAL TACTICS**:
Encourage creative use of terrain:
• Push icicles onto ice patches (prone)
• Use stalagmites for cover
• Trigger rockfall (ranged attack DC 12)
• Fire sources melt icicles faster (double damage)

**BABY DRAGON**:
• Doesn't participate in combat (too young)
• Creates emotional stakes (party must protect it)
• Optional: One-time Frost Breath if party desperate
• If dragon endangered, mother might sense distress (future consequence)

**AFTERMATH REWARDS**:
• Backpack with supplies (torches needed for cave exploration)
• Evidence of missing patrol (emotional continuity)
• Party learns fire > ice (tactical lesson)

**PACING**: Keep combat fast—2-3 rounds maximum. Icicles should feel threatening but not overwhelming.]]></text></note>

<encounter><name>Pinebrook: Challenge 1 - Climbing Icy Walls</name><uid>2152</uid>
<state>0</state><current>0</current><round>0</round>
<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The cave passage narrows ahead, and you find yourselves facing a sheer wall of ice rising fifty feet above you. The surface gleams like polished glass, covered in a thin layer of frost. Handholds are scarce, and the air grows colder as you gaze upward. Far above, you can just make out the continuation of the passage.

The baby dragon chirps, looking up at the wall, then back at you expectantly.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SKILL CHALLENGE**: Climbing a treacherous icy wall to progress deeper into the lair

**LOCATION**: Narrow passage inside dragon's mountain lair

**SITUATION**: After defeating living icicles at cave entrance, party must navigate physical challenges to reach hatching chamber. First obstacle: 50-foot vertical climb up ice-covered wall blocking passage.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE CHALLENGE**:

**50-Foot Icy Wall**:
• Sheer vertical surface
• Ice-covered stone with minimal handholds
• Frost makes surface slippery
• Only way forward is up

**SUCCESS MECHANIC**:
• **DC 10 Athletics or Acrobatics check**
• Success: Climb safely to top (describe skilled ascent)
• Failure: Take **1d6 falling damage** before reaching top (slipped partway up)

**BABY DRAGON CARRIER**:
Character carrying dragon gets **advantage** on check if they fall—dragon instinctively spreads wings to slow descent (weighs almost nothing).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**NOORAH'S CLIMBER'S KIT** (if premade character present):

If Noorah Eldenfield is in party:
• She has **Climber's Kit** (special spikes, boot tips, gloves, harness)
• Grants **advantage** on Athletics checks to climb
• After she reaches top, can secure rope for others

**ROPE ASSISTANCE**:
If any character reaches top and secures rope:
• Remaining characters can climb **without check** (rope provides safety)
• Describe how rope makes ascent much easier

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RUNNING THE CHALLENGE**:

Have each player roll DC 10 Athletics or Acrobatics:
• **Success (10+)**: *"You find handholds in the ice and climb steadily upward, your fingers numb but your grip sure. After several minutes of careful climbing, you pull yourself over the top."*
• **Failure (9 or less)**: Roll 1d6 damage. *"Halfway up, your hand slips on a patch of frost. You slide down several feet, scraping against the rough ice, before catching yourself on a outcropping. (Take [X] damage.) Gritting your teeth, you resume climbing and eventually reach the top."*

**DESCRIBING THE ACTION**:
Encourage players to describe their climbing style:
• Methodical and careful?
• Bold and quick?
• Helping each other with encouragement?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM TIPS**:

**Climber's Kit Advantage**:
If player says "I use my climber's kit," grant advantage immediately. This teaches players to reference equipment.

**Creative Solutions**:
• Ice picks/pitons: Grant advantage
• Mage Hand spell: Can test handholds, grant advantage  
• Jump/Levitate spell: Bypass challenge entirely
• Fire spells to melt handholds: DC 8 instead of DC 10

**Pacing**:
This is first of three challenges. Keep it brief—each player makes one check, describe results, move on. Should take 5 minutes.

**Failure Isn't Catastrophic**:
Taking 1d6 damage (average 3-4) won't kill anyone, but creates tension. Reinforces that this lair is dangerous even outside combat.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**AFTER EVERYONE CLIMBS**:

Read when all party members reach top:

*"You stand on a wide ledge at the top of the climb, catching your breath in the frigid air. The baby dragon chirps happily, seemingly energized by being closer to home. The passage ahead continues deeper into the mountain, and you can hear the faint sound of dripping water echoing from somewhere ahead."*

**PROGRESS**:
• Challenge 1 of 3 complete
• Next: Magical ice mirror (Bahamut's test)
• Dragon continues to guide party deeper

**DM NOTE**: Party learning that reaching hatching chamber requires more than combat—physical challenges and puzzles await. Ice mirror challenge ahead will test knowledge and puzzle-solving.]]></text>

<note>
<name>Challenge 1 DM Notes</name>
<text><![CDATA[**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 5 minutes

**PURPOSE**:
• Introduce skill challenges (not just combat)
• Create tension without combat
• Teach players to use equipment/spells creatively
• Build atmosphere (dangerous lair)

**ADJUSTMENTS**:

**3 or fewer players**: Reduce damage die to 1d4

**Party struggling with checks**:
• First character to reach top can help others (advantage)
• Baby dragon makes encouraging chirps (+2 morale bonus)
• Reduce DC to 8 for final character

**Party breezing through**:
• Describe handholds crumbling as they climb
• Frost falling from above (cosmetic, no mechanical effect)
• Emphasize cold and danger

**EQUIPMENT SPOTLIGHT**:
Noorah's Climber's Kit is specifically designed to shine here. If she's present, make sure player knows they have it and what it does.

**ROPE MECHANICS**:
If anyone has 50+ feet of rope, they can secure it at top. This lets remaining party bypass check—teamwork rewarded.

**BABY DRAGON ROLE**:
Dragon carrier has advantage if they fail—dragon's wings slow fall. Creates sweet moment and mechanical benefit. Dragon weighs very little, not encumbering.]]></text>

The passage opens into a small chamber, and you stop short. Blocking the way forward is a sheet of perfectly transparent ice, smooth as polished glass and impossibly thin. Through it, you can see the continuation of the cave passage beyond.

As you approach, your reflections shimmer strangely in the ice—and then they change. Where you should see yourselves, you instead see silver dragons, majestic and proud. The baby dragon you carry appears as a human toddler with silver hair.

Deep within the ice, a shape begins to form. A massive draconic form materializes before you—not silver, but gleaming platinum, with scales that seem to hold all colors of light at once. Ancient, wise eyes regard you from within the frozen mirror.

A voice resonates through the chamber, speaking directly into your minds:

"I am Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, King of the Good Dragons. Before you may pass, answer me true: What type of creature are you escorting home?"

The words hang in the cold air. The question must be answered—but how?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PUZZLE CHALLENGE**: Answer Bahamut's question in Draconic to pass

**LOCATION**: Magical ice barrier inside dragon's lair

**SITUATION**: After climbing icy wall, party encounters magical ice mirror—test placed by Bahamut (platinum dragon god) to protect silver dragon's lair. Must answer question correctly IN DRACONIC LANGUAGE to proceed.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE ICE MIRROR**:

**Magical Properties**:
• Thin sheet of solid ice blocking passage
• Transparent—can see through to other side
• Reflections show party as silver dragons, baby as human toddler
• Cannot be bypassed (climbed over, gone around)
• Breaking it is possible but has consequences

**BAHAMUT'S APPEARANCE**:
• Platinum dragon form manifests within ice
• Ancient, wise, radiating divine power
• Not hostile—testing party's worthiness
• King of Good Dragons, deity of justice and protection

**THE QUESTION**:
*"What type of creature are you escorting home?"*

Must be answered in **Draconic language**.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SOLUTION**:

**CORRECT ANSWER**: "Orn darastrix" (silver dragon in Draconic)

**HOW TO FIND ANSWER**:

**Captain Kole's Book Page**:
Remember Captain Emmajeen Kole gave party a page from her Draconic language book (Encounter 1). Page contains translation of dragon-related words, including "orn darastrix" = silver dragon.

If players remember book page:
• They can reference it directly
• Answer question correctly
• Ice melts immediately

If players don't remember:
• Prompt: "Does anyone have anything that might help with Draconic words?"
• Check character sheets/inventory
• Captain Kole specifically gave them translation page for this reason

**ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS**:

**Speak Draconic**:
If any character speaks Draconic (unlikely at level 1-3):
• They can translate immediately
• Automatic success

**Knowledge Checks**:
Allow DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana, History, or Religion) to:
• Identify Bahamut (DC 10)
• Remember "silver dragon" translations (DC 15)  
• Recall baby dragon IS silver dragon (obvious to party)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SUCCESS - ANSWER CORRECTLY**:

When party says "orn darastrix" (or translates correctly):

*"The platinum dragon's eyes gleam with approval. 'Well spoken, and true. You honor my child's mother with your care. Pass, and be blessed.'*

*The ice begins to shimmer and dissolve, melting away into water that flows across the cave floor. But this water is different—it glows with soft silver light, and where it touches your boots, you feel warmth spread through you. Wounds close, exhaustion fades, and you feel renewed."*

**REWARDS FOR SUCCESS**:
• Ice melts—path clear
• **Healing water restores ALL hit points to maximum** for entire party
• **Advantage on next challenge** (Challenge 3: navigating ice slides)
• Bahamut's blessing acknowledged—party worthy of helping dragons

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FAILURE - BREAKING THE ICE**:

If party tries to break ice instead of answering:

**Breaking Options**:
• Melee attacks: Describe hitting ice
• Fire spells: Melts slowly  
• Smashing with tools: Shattering sounds

When ice breaks:

*"The ice shatters with a sound like breaking glass. Shards of razor-sharp ice explode outward, and freezing water sprays across the passage."*

**CONSEQUENCES**:
• Each character takes **1d6 cold damage** (from ice shards and freezing water)
• **NO healing water effect** (destroyed magical blessing)
• **NO advantage on next challenge**
• Can continue forward, but lost opportunity

Bahamut's voice echoes with disappointment:
*"Strength without wisdom breaks what patience would have opened."*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**IDENTIFYING BAHAMUT**:

**DC 10 Arcana, History, or Religion check** reveals:
• This is Bahamut, Platinum Dragon
• Deity of good dragons, justice, and protection
• Most lawful good and powerful of dragon gods
• Particularly watches over metallic dragons (silver, gold, bronze, brass, copper)
• Silver dragons are his favored children

This information reinforces: Answer his question correctly, don't attack.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RUNNING THE CHALLENGE**:

**Step 1**: Describe ice mirror and changed reflections
**Step 2**: Bahamut appears, asks question
**Step 3**: Players discuss how to answer
**Step 4**: Prompt about Captain Kole's translation page if they're stuck
**Step 5**: Players answer or break ice
**Step 6**: Resolve consequences (healing water or damage)

**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 5-10 minutes

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM TIPS**:

**Translation Page Location**:
If players can't find page in notes:
• "Captain Kole gave you a page torn from her Draconic language book. Does anyone have that in their notes?"
• Show Appendix A page (Draconic translations) if using physical handouts
• Baby dragon points at page with claw (cute moment)

**Players Answering Wrong**:
If they answer in Common ("silver dragon") instead of Draconic:
• Bahamut: "Close, but not quite. Think on the language of my kind."
• Give second chance
• Baby dragon makes chirping sounds (hint: speak in dragon language)

**Players Completely Stuck**:
After 5 minutes of discussion with no progress:
• Baby dragon chirps and points at translation page
• Captain Kole's voice echoes in memory: "Keep this safe—you'll need it"
• Direct them to inventory/notes

**Reward Importance**:
Full healing here is significant—party likely damaged from Living Icicles and climbing wall. Advantage on Challenge 3 makes next obstacle easier. Rewarding clever puzzle-solving.

**Alternate Language Solutions**:
If player comes up with creative translation method (Comprehend Languages spell, magic item, etc.), allow it to work. Reward creativity.]]></text>

<note>
<name>Challenge 2 DM Notes</name>
<text><![CDATA[**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 5-10 minutes

**PURPOSE**:
• Puzzle-solving challenge (not combat or skill check)
• Reward players for paying attention to earlier clues
• Introduce Bahamut (important dragon deity)
• Provide meaningful healing opportunity
• Test problem-solving and teamwork

**CAPTAIN KOLE'S TRANSLATION PAGE**:
This was given in Encounter 1 specifically for this puzzle. Page contains:
• "Nytha" = Mama (baby dragon's first word)
• "Orn darastrix" = Silver dragon (puzzle answer)
• Other basic Draconic words

**PUZZLE FAIRNESS**:
Party has everything needed to solve this:
✓ They know baby is silver dragon
✓ They have translation page with "orn darastrix"
✓ Question clearly asks what type of creature
✓ Baby dragon can provide hints if needed

**IF PLAYERS MISS CLUE**:
Don't let them spin wheels for more than 5 minutes. Provide increasingly direct hints:
1. "Does anyone have anything from Captain Kole?"
2. Baby dragon chirps and nudges translation page
3. "The words 'orn darastrix' catch your eye on the page"

**BAHAMUT'S ROLE**:
Not adversary—guardian and tester. He WANTS party to succeed (they're helping his children). Will give hints through tone and expression if they're close.

**BREAKING ICE CONSEQUENCE**:
1d6 damage isn't devastating, but losing healing water and advantage on Challenge 3 is significant. Make sure players understand they had better option.

**HEALING WATER MECHANICS**:
When players answer correctly:
• Restores ALL hit points to maximum
• Removes exhaustion if any
• Feels like blessing (warm, renewing)
• Advantage on next challenge lasts until Challenge 3 resolved

**REFLECTIONS MEANING**:
Party appears as silver dragons = Bahamut sees their inner nature (protectors, helpers)
Baby appears as human child = testing if they see beyond appearance
Clever foreshadowing: Who you ARE vs. what you LOOK LIKE

**KNOWLEDGE CHECK ALTERNATIVES**:
If party has no translation page (lost notes, forgotten):
• DC 15 Intelligence check can recall "orn darastrix"
• Any dragon-related proficiency helps
• Advantage if they state they're trying to remember Draconic words]]></text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

The passage ahead ends abruptly at the edge of a sheer cliff overlooking an enormous cavern. Far below—at least eighty feet down—you can see the continuation of the passage leading deeper into the mountain.

But between you and the bottom lies a nightmare of ice: dozens of smooth, frozen slides crisscross the cavern, some merging together, others splitting apart. They loop, spiral, and intersect at dizzying angles. Some slides end at the safe passage below. Others end at sheer drops, razor-sharp ice formations, or solid walls.

Before you can study the routes more carefully, an ominous CRACK echoes through the chamber. The cliff beneath your feet shudders. Chunks of ice break free and plummet into the darkness.

"The cliff is collapsing!" someone shouts.

You have seconds to choose a slide and jump.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SKILL CHALLENGE**: Navigate maze of icy slides to reach bottom safely

**LOCATION**: Cliff overlooking massive cavern with interconnected ice slides

**SITUATION**: After passing Bahamut's test, party reaches final physical challenge before hatching chamber. Must quickly choose safe route through maze of icy slides as cliff collapses beneath them. Wrong choice means dangerous mid-slide corrections.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE CHALLENGE**:

**Collapsing Cliff + Ice Slide Maze**:
• Standing on icy cliff 80 feet above cavern floor
• Dozens of slides crisscross below—some safe, most dangerous
• Cliff collapsing—must jump immediately
• Each character chooses a slide (or follows someone)

**URGENCY**:
Cliff actively crumbling. No time for long discussion. Players must make quick decisions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FINDING SAFE PATH** (Step 1):

Before jumping, character can try to identify safe slide:

**DC 10 Investigation or Perception check**:
• **Success**: Spot slide that merges smoothly with others and ends at safe passage
• **Failure**: All slides look equally dangerous (can't tell which is safe)

**Advantage Sources**:
• Bahamut's blessing (if got healing water in Challenge 2): **Advantage on this check**
• High ground: Advantage on Perception
• Darkvision: Can see details in dim light

**TIME LIMIT**:
Each player gets ONE check, then must jump. Cliff collapsing—no retries.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SLIDING DOWN** (Step 2):

After everyone jumps:

**IF FOUND SAFE PATH** (succeeded Investigation/Perception):

*"You leap onto the slide you identified and immediately start flying downward. The ice is smooth as glass beneath you. The slide loops and turns, your stomach lurching as you go upside down, spiral around other slides, and shoot through narrow gaps. It's terrifying—but exhilarating. After a wild ride, your slide curves gently upward and you slide to a stop at the bottom, unharmed."*

**RESULT**: No damage, describe thrilling ride safely completed.

---

**IF CHOSE DANGEROUS PATH** (failed Investigation/Perception):

*"You jump onto a slide at random and immediately plummet. Within seconds, you realize this slide is intersecting with others—and you're headed for disaster. You have one chance to switch slides before it's too late."*

**DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check**:
• **Success**: Managed to jump between slides mid-descent, avoid hazards, reach bottom safely
• **Failure**: Roll 1d6 damage—character hits ice shards, takes long drop, or smashes into ice wall before reaching bottom

**RESULT**: 
• Success: Describe acrobatic mid-air corrections, dramatic near-misses
• Failure: Describe collision (ice shards, wall impact, awkward landing) + damage

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SPECIAL CASES**:

**Characters Without Acrobatics/Athletics**:
Can still attempt DC 15 check with no modifier (straight d20 roll). Makes success harder but not impossible.

**Following Another Character**:
If Character A finds safe path, Character B can say "I follow them!"
• Character B must make DC 10 Perception check to follow correctly
• Success: Takes same safe slide, no danger
• Failure: Loses sight of leader mid-descent, must make DC 15 Acrobatics/Athletics

**DM TIP - Increase Difficulty**:
If first character finds safe path and everyone tries to follow:
• "The top of the safe slide collapses just after [Character A] starts down it!"
• Each subsequent character must find own path
• Prevents one good roll from trivializing challenge

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DESCRIBING THE ACTION**:

Encourage players to describe their wild ride:
• How do they position their body on the slide?
• What goes through their mind as they spiral and loop?
• Do they help each other or go solo?
• What do they shout as they plummet?

**EXAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS**:

Safe Path Success:
*"You tuck your arms tight and lean into each turn. The slide loops completely upside-down and you scream as you see the cavern ceiling above you. Then gravity pulls you back down, the slide merges with two others, and you shoot through a gap barely wider than your shoulders before gliding smoothly to the bottom."*

Dangerous Path Success:
*"You're headed straight for a wall of jagged ice spikes. At the last second, you throw your weight sideways and LEAP to an adjacent slide. You land hard, skid wildly, but manage to stay on. The rest of the descent is a blur of near-misses, but you reach the bottom in one piece."*

Dangerous Path Failure (1d6 damage):
*"You try to switch slides but misjudge the angle. Your shoulder slams into a razor-sharp ice formation and pain explodes through you. You tumble the rest of the way down, finally sliding to a stop at the bottom, battered but alive. (Take [X] damage.)"*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**AFTER EVERYONE REACHES BOTTOM**:

When entire party at bottom of slides:

*"You lie on the cold stone floor at the bottom of the cavern, hearts pounding, adrenaline surging. That was terrifying—but you made it. The baby dragon chirrups excitedly from inside the backpack, apparently having LOVED the wild ride. Ahead, the passage continues deeper into the mountain, and you can hear faint sounds echoing from somewhere close by."*

**PARTY STATUS CHECK**:
• Quick moment to catch breath
• Assess injuries (healing if needed)
• Prepare for final encounter

**FORESHADOWING**:
• "Faint sounds": Egg snatchers moving in hatching chamber ahead
• Dragon chirping excitedly: Recognizes home, nest nearby
• Passage clearly leads to heart of lair

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM TIPS**:

**Pacing**:
This challenge should feel URGENT and CHAOTIC:
• Collapsing cliff creates time pressure
• Describe ice falling around them
• Limit discussion time—cliff won't wait
• Each character gets 30 seconds to decide and roll

**Bahamut's Blessing**:
If party got healing water and advantage in Challenge 2:
• Advantage on Investigation/Perception here makes finding safe path easier
• Reward for solving puzzle correctly

**Damage**:
1d6 damage (average 3-4) isn't lethal but adds up with Challenge 1 damage. Party should feel battered by time they reach hatching chamber. Makes stakes higher.

**Creative Solutions**:
• Feather Fall spell: Automatic success, bypass slides entirely
• Rope tied between party: Advantage to follow leader
• Magic that slows falling: Reduce DC to 10
• Flying familiar scouts ahead: Advantage on Investigation

**Adjusting Difficulty**:

**3 or fewer players**: Reduce damage die to 1d4

**Party already hurt**: Let Bahamut's blessing provide +2 bonus instead of advantage

**Party needs more challenge**: Describe slides collapsing mid-descent—increase tension

**Following the Leader**:
If players cleverly work together (one scouts, others follow), REWARD it:
• First character finds path: Others get advantage to follow
• Roped together: All use highest roll
• Teamwork should be encouraged and mechanically beneficial

**Final Challenge Complete**:
After this, party proceeds directly to Encounter 4: Egg Snatchers in Hatching Chamber. Build anticipation—sounds of combat ahead, dragon urgent to reach nest, time running out.]]></text>

<note>
<name>Challenge 3 DM Notes</name>
<text><![CDATA[**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 5-10 minutes

**PURPOSE**:
• High-energy skill challenge with urgency
• Reward Investigation/Perception and Acrobatics/Athletics
• Create dramatic cinematic moment (wild ice slide ride)
• Build tension before final combat
• Exhaust some resources before big fight

**CHALLENGE FLOW**:

**Step 1**: Describe collapsing cliff + maze of slides
**Step 2**: Time pressure—30 seconds per player to decide
**Step 3**: Roll Investigation or Perception (DC 10) to find safe path
**Step 4**: Jump onto slides
**Step 5**: Resolve:
- Found safe path = automatic success, describe thrilling ride
- Didn't find safe path = DC 15 Acrobatics/Athletics or take 1d6 damage
**Step 6**: Everyone reaches bottom, proceed to hatching chamber

**URGENCY IS KEY**:
Don't let players overthink this. Cliff is collapsing. They have seconds. Build tension:
• Describe ice breaking away beneath feet
• Baby dragon squealing in alarm
• Rumbling sounds getting louder
• "You need to jump NOW!"

**BAHAMUT'S BLESSING PAYOFF**:
If party solved ice mirror puzzle correctly:
• They have advantage on Investigation/Perception here
• Makes finding safe path much easier
• Clear mechanical reward for earlier puzzle success
• Reinforces: Good choices earlier help later

**DAMAGE ACCUMULATION**:
By now, party may have taken damage from:
• Challenge 1: 1d6 if failed climb
• Challenge 2: 1d6 if broke ice mirror
• Challenge 3: 1d6 if failed acrobatics

Total possible damage before final combat: 3d6 (average 10-11). Party should feel worn down. Makes egg snatchers fight more tense.

**SAFE PATH COLLAPSE**:
Use the "slide collapses after first character" trick ONLY if:
• Party working together well
• First character succeeded and everyone following
• You want to ensure each player rolls

Don't use if:
• Party already struggling
• Multiple players failed Investigation
• Time running short

**FOLLOWING THE LEADER**:
If party ropes themselves together or coordinates:
• First person finds safe path (succeeds Investigation)
• Others follow—give them advantage on their own Investigation checks
• Reward teamwork mechanically

**CREATIVE BYPASSES**:
Feather Fall, Levitate, Fly, or similar spells bypass challenge entirely:
• Allow it—reward creative spell use
• Describe floating/flying safely down
• Other party members still need to use slides
• No damage, no checks needed

**WILD RIDE DESCRIPTIONS**:
This should feel like a theme park ride gone wrong:
• Loops and spirals
• Upside-down moments
• Near-misses with ice formations
• Seeing other party members on adjacent slides
• Screaming, laughing, adrenaline

Even safe path should feel THRILLING, just not dangerous. Success means controlled chaos.

**AFTERMATH**:
Short breather at bottom:
• Assess injuries
• Prepare for combat (final encounter imminent)
• Dragon guiding them toward nest chamber
• Sounds of egg snatchers ahead (low hissing, scraping)

**TRANSITION**:
*"It's a short walk from the bottom of the cave to the hatching cavern. The baby dragon is chirping urgently now, pulling toward the passage ahead. You ready your weapons and move forward... into Encounter 4."*]]></text>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

You emerge into a vast natural cavern, its ceiling soaring forty feet overhead and shot through with cracks that allow pale blue light to filter down through the ice. Massive stalactites and stalagmites, coated in thick layers of frost, fill the chamber like a frozen forest.

In the center of the room sits a nest—a bowl carved from frozen snow, with four indentations. Two enormous silver eggs rest within, their surfaces gleaming with faint inner light. Broken shell fragments fill a third depression. The fourth is empty.

But you're not alone.

Three horse-sized creatures surround the nest—amphibious monstrosities with pure white skin, frog-like bodies, and mouths bristling with razor-sharp teeth. They turn toward you and HISS, their eyes gleaming with predatory hunger.

With powerful legs coiled beneath them, they leap.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT ENCOUNTER**: Defending dragon eggs from ice troll servants

**LOCATION**: Dragon's hatching chamber deep inside mountain lair

**TRIGGER**: Party navigates cave challenges and reaches hatching cavern

**SITUATION**:
After overcoming cave dangers (icy walls, magic mirror, dangerous slides), party reaches heart of silver dragon's lair: the hatching chamber. But egg snatchers—amphibious creatures trained by ice trolls—are attempting to steal remaining dragon eggs. Party must stop them before eggs are lost forever.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**HATCHING CHAMBER DESCRIPTION**:

Massive natural cavern carved by ancient glaciers:
• 60 feet across, 40 feet high
• Stalactites and stalagmites covered in thick ice
• Ceiling slopes upward to ice-plugged opening (dragon's entrance)
• Center of room: Nest made of frozen snow, shaped into bowl
• Natural light filters through ice ceiling (dim blue glow)

**THE NEST**:
• Four indentations in snow nest
• **Egg 1**: Silver egg (intact, unhatched)
• **Egg 2**: Silver egg (intact, unhatched)
• **Egg 3**: Broken shell pieces (baby dragon party carries—hatched recently)
• **Egg 4**: Empty indentation (egg stolen by trolls days ago)

**IMMEDIATE THREAT**:
Three **egg snatchers** surround nest. They're:
• Horse-sized amphibious creatures
• Frog-like bodies with pure white skin
• Mouths full of sharp teeth
• Moving toward remaining eggs
• Will fight to complete mission (steal eggs for ice troll masters)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT TRIGGER**:

As party enters chamber, read:

*"This large chamber is filled with ice-covered stalactites and stalagmites. In the center, two enormous silver eggs rest in a nest of frozen snow. Between you and the eggs stand three strange creatures—each the size of a horse with frog-like bodies, pure white skin, and mouths full of razor-sharp teeth. They turn toward you and HISS. Then with powerful leaps, they hurl themselves at you!"*

**EGG SNATCHERS (3)**:
• Trained by ice trolls to steal dragon eggs
• Amphibious hunters with powerful jaws
• Aggressive and persistent
• Will fight to death to complete mission

**BABY DRAGON REACTION**:
Wyrmling recognizes home—chirps excitedly, struggles to reach nest. Party must decide whether to hold dragon or let it go to nest (tactical choice).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TERRAIN FEATURES**:

**Hatching Chamber Layout**:
• **Ice Stalagmites**: Provide half cover, can be toppled onto enemies (DC 12 STR check, 2d6 bludgeoning)
• **Frozen Snow Nest**: Difficult terrain around edges, center is smooth
• **Ice Ceiling**: Fragile—loud sounds or explosions might cause ice chunks to fall (1d6 bludgeoning, DC 12 DEX save)
• **Slippery Floor**: DC 10 Acrobatics to avoid falling prone when moving more than 20 ft in one turn

**Light**:
• Dim blue light from ice-filtered sunlight above
• Dark shadows behind stalagmites
• Nest area is brightest (eggs glow faintly)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**EGG SNATCHER TACTICS**:

**Round 1**: All three snatchers leap toward party (30 ft jump)
**Round 2**: Focus attacks on whoever is closest to nest OR carrying baby dragon
**Round 3+**: If an egg snatcher is unengaged, it attempts to grab an egg and flee

**Egg Theft Attempt**:
If egg snatcher reaches nest uncontested:
• Uses action to grab egg in jaws
• Next turn: Attempts to flee (30 ft jump toward exit)
• Egg is fragile—if snatcher takes damage while holding egg, DC 12 DEX save or egg cracks (future dragon dies)

**Special Behavior**:
• Powerful Leap: Can jump 30 feet horizontally without running start
• Amphibious: Breath water and air (irrelevant here but explains biology)
• Pack Tactics: Advantage on attacks if ally is within 5 ft of target
• Morale: Fight to death—trained by trolls, fear punishment more than death

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PROTECTING THE EGGS**:

Party has multiple challenges:
1. **Defeat egg snatchers** before they steal eggs
2. **Protect baby dragon** (snatchers will kill wyrmling if they can)
3. **Don't damage eggs** (friendly fire, area attacks risky near nest)

**Tactical Options**:
• Position party members between snatchers and nest
• Grapple snatchers to prevent egg theft
• Focus fire to eliminate snatchers quickly
• Use environment (topple stalagmites, cause ice falls)
• Let baby dragon reach nest (provides cover, boosts morale)

**BABY DRAGON IN COMBAT**:
If wyrmling reaches nest:
• Curls protectively around unhatched siblings
• Makes itself small target (half cover)
• Occasionally breathes tiny frost puff (no damage, just cute)
• Snatchers will NOT attack baby—mission is to steal INTACT eggs only

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**COMBAT COMPLICATIONS** (Optional):

**Round 3**: Mother dragon heard fighting—she's returning!
• Distant roar echoes through mountain
• Ice chunks fall from ceiling (1d6 damage, DC 12 DEX save)
• Snatchers panic—attack more desperately

**Round 4+**: If combat extends this long:
• Mother dragon crashes through ice ceiling
• Lands in chamber with thunderous impact
• Combat ENDS—mother immediately kills remaining egg snatchers
• Party must explain presence (transition to conclusion)

**DM NOTE**: Don't let combat drag past 4 rounds. Mother dragon's arrival is natural conclusion if party struggles.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**AFTERMATH**:

Once egg snatchers defeated:

**Baby Dragon**: Crawls into nest, curls up with broken eggshells, falls asleep immediately. Safe at last.

**Examining Chamber**:
• **DC 13 Investigation** (searching room): Find frozen remains of earlier egg snatcher—killed by mother dragon weeks ago
• **DC 14 Nature** (examining eggs): Eggs are healthy, will hatch in 1-2 weeks
• **Broken Shell Analysis**: Third egg hatched prematurely when stolen—baby got separated during chaos

**Treasure** (if party searches):
• Behind nest: Small pile of silver coins (45 sp)
• Ice troll pouch (dropped by snatcher): Contains crude map showing troll lair location (plot hook for future)
• Frozen dragon scale (silver, palm-sized): Worth 50 gp, or can be used to craft magic item

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MOTHER DRAGON ARRIVES**:

Before party can leave:

*"A LOUD CRASH erupts from high above. Chunks of ice and snow fall around you as an enormous silver dragon bursts through the frozen ceiling. She plummets and lands before you, frigid air streaming from between sharp teeth. 'WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?' the dragon roars."*

**Transition to Conclusion**:
Party must explain their presence and actions. If they:
• Protected eggs: Mother is grateful
• Returned baby: Mother is overjoyed
• Killed egg snatchers: Mother is impressed
• Did all three: Mother considers party heroes, offers reward and alliance

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM GUIDANCE**:

**Purpose**: Climactic combat that tests party's skills and creates emotional payoff for entire adventure.

**Difficulty**: Challenging but fair for level 1-2 party. Three CR 1 creatures = 600 XP total.

**Pacing**: Should take 3-4 rounds. If faster, add complications. If slower, trigger mother's arrival.

**Emotional Stakes**: Party has bonded with baby dragon. Eggs represent innocent lives. Egg snatchers are CLEAR villains (stealing babies = evil). No moral ambiguity—party should feel heroic defeating them.

**Reward**: Material treasure is minor (silver coins, dragon scale). TRUE reward is mother dragon's gratitude and future alliance (campaign-level consequence).]]></text>

<note><name>DM Guidance: Egg Snatcher Combat</name><text><![CDATA[**PURPOSE**: Climactic battle with clear stakes (save innocent dragon eggs), emotional payoff (reunite baby with mother), and campaign consequences (dragon ally).

**DIFFICULTY**: Challenging for level 1-2 party. Three CR 1 creatures = 600 XP total. Designed to feel epic without being lethal.

**KEY MECHANICS**:
• **Pack Tactics**: Snatchers should coordinate—flank when possible
• **Standing Leap**: Use this liberally—snatchers jump around battlefield, make combat dynamic
• **Grapple**: If snatcher grapples PC, ally must rescue them
• **Egg Threat**: Creates urgency—party can't just focus on offense, must defend eggs

**TACTICAL VARIETY**:
Don't have all three snatchers do same thing each round:
• Snatcher 1: Attacks frontline fighter
• Snatcher 2: Leaps past defenders toward nest
• Snatcher 3: Flanks spellcaster with Snatcher 1

**PROTECTING EGGS**:
This is KEY tension point. Party must balance:
• Fighting snatchers
• Preventing egg theft
• Protecting baby dragon
• Conserving HP for mother's arrival

**If Snatcher Reaches Nest**:
• Takes full round to grab egg
• Party gets one round to intervene
• If snatcher escapes with egg: Chase scene (optional) OR egg is lost (consequence)

**SCALING OPTIONS**:
• **Easy Mode** (3 or fewer players): Remove 1 snatcher OR reduce HP to 12 each
• **Hard Mode** (5+ players): Add 1 snatcher OR give snatchers +2 HP each
• **Party Struggling**: Mother arrives early (Round 3), kills 1 snatcher, leaves rest for party
• **Party Dominating**: Add complication (ice fall, more snatchers arrive)

**MOTHER DRAGON TIMING**:
She should arrive AFTER combat ends in most cases. But if:
• Combat drags past 4 rounds: She arrives to end fight
• Party TPK imminent: She arrives to save them (they're protecting her babies—she's grateful)
• Egg is stolen: She arrives to pursue thief (party can help track)

**EMOTIONAL BEATS**:
• Baby dragon reaching nest = heartwarming moment (describe it beautifully)
• Party protecting eggs = heroic sacrifice (reward this narratively)
• Defeating snatchers = triumph (mother's gratitude feels EARNED)

**TREASURE**:
Keep it modest. Real reward is dragon alliance, not loot. Silver coins and dragon scale are tokens, not main prizes.

**AFTERMATH**:
After combat, give party 1-2 minutes to catch breath, examine chamber, celebrate victory BEFORE mother arrives. This makes her entrance more dramatic and lets party feel accomplished first.]]></text></note>

<text><![CDATA[READ ALOUD:

Before you can do anything else, a deafening CRASH erupts from high above. You look up as massive chunks of ice and snow explode downward from the ceiling. An enormous shape descends through the frozen opening—a dragon the size of a small house, with scales like polished silver mirrors and wings that span the entire chamber.

The dragon lands before you with earth-shaking impact. Freezing air streams from between rows of razor-sharp teeth. Ancient, intelligent eyes fix on you with an intensity that makes your breath catch.

"WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?" the dragon roars, her voice shaking the very walls of the cavern.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ROLEPLAY ENCOUNTER**: Explaining yourselves to the mother dragon

**LOCATION**: Hatching chamber immediately after defeating egg snatchers

**SITUATION**: Party successfully defended dragon eggs from ice troll servants. Now mother silver dragon Hysvearorn has returned and found strangers in her lair with her baby. Party must explain themselves, prove they're allies, and forge alliance with powerful dragon.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MOTHER DRAGON**: Hysvearorn ("Soaring Silver")

**Full Name**: Hysvearorn (HIS-vee-air-orn)
**Nickname**: Rorn (easier for non-dragons to pronounce)
**Type**: Adult Silver Dragon
**Age**: Several centuries old
**Size**: 30+ feet long, wingspan 60+ feet
**Power**: CR 15—far beyond party's ability to defeat

**INITIAL EMOTIONAL STATE**:
• **Angry**: Strangers in her lair, near her eggs
• **Confused**: Why are adventurers here? Are they thieves?
• **Protective**: Fierce maternal instinct—will kill to protect wyrmlings
• **Suspicious**: Ice trolls just attacked; doesn't know if party is threat

**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**:
• Scales gleam like polished silver mirrors
• Wings span entire chamber when spread
• Freezing breath visible as frost in air
• Ancient, intelligent eyes—clearly sapient and wise
• Regal bearing—this is a noble creature, not mindless beast

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PARTY'S CHALLENGE**: Prove they're allies, not enemies

**WHAT DRAGON SEES**:
• Armed strangers inside her lair
• Her baby dragon with them
• Dead egg snatchers on ground
• Two intact eggs safe in nest
• One egg hatched (shell fragments)
• One egg missing

**WHAT DRAGON DOESN'T KNOW**:
• Party rescued baby after it wandered from lair
• Party just saved remaining eggs from being stolen
• Party fought through challenges to return wyrmling home
• Egg snatchers attacked Captain Kole's patrol first

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RUNNING THE ROLEPLAY**:

**Step 1 - Dragon's Question**:

Rorn waits for explanation. Her tone is dangerous—not hostile yet, but capable of turning hostile instantly if party says wrong thing.

*"I will ask once more: What are you doing in my lair?"*

**Step 2 - Party Explains**:

Give players opportunity to roleplay. Ask prompting questions if they hesitate:
• "What do you say to the dragon?"
• "How does your character feel standing before a creature this powerful?"
• "What can you do to prove you're here to help, not harm?"

**GOOD RESPONSES** (Rorn calms down):
• "We found your baby in the forest and brought it home"
• "We fought creatures trying to steal your eggs"
• "We're not thieves—we're protectors"
• Showing baby dragon (who chirps happily at mother)
• Pointing to dead egg snatchers as proof

**BAD RESPONSES** (Rorn grows more suspicious):
• Attacking her (see DM Tips below)
• Threatening her
• Demanding reward first
• Lying about circumstances
• Claiming ownership of dragon/eggs

**Step 3 - Baby Confirms Story**:

As party explains, baby dragon wiggles free and crawls to mother, chirping excitedly. Rorn listens as baby "tells" her what happened (telepathic/empathic bond):
• Hatched alone when mother was gone
• Wandered into forest, got lost
• Party found it, fed it, protected it
• Living icicles attacked, party defended baby
• Egg snatchers tried to steal siblings, party stopped them

**Step 4 - Rorn's Realization**:

After hearing full story from party AND baby:

*"I see," Rorn says, her voice softening. The anger drains from her eyes, replaced by gratitude and relief. "You did not come to steal. You came to return. You saved not one, but THREE of my children." She bows her massive head. "You have my deepest thanks, brave ones. Few would risk themselves for a lost wyrmling."*

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**ROLEPLAYING HYSVEARORN (RORN)**:

**Personality Traits**:
• **Wise and ancient**: Centuries of experience, speaks with measured thoughtfulness
• **Protective mother**: Fiercely defends young, but loving and gentle once threat passed
• **Values courage and honor**: Respects party for risking themselves to help
• **Friendly when calm**: Silver dragons LIKE people, enjoy sharing stories
• **Noble**: Operates by code of honor—repays debts, keeps promises

**Speech Patterns**:
• Formal but not archaic: "You have my thanks" not "Thou hast mine gratitude"
• Occasionally draconic words: "Wyrmling" instead of "baby dragon"
• Refers to self in first person: "I" and "my," not "this dragon"
• Wise and measured: Thinks before speaking, considers consequences

**INFORMATION RORN CAN SHARE**:

If party asks about eggs/trolls/situation:

**About Her Lair**:
• "I recently made my lair here to prepare for my wyrmlings' hatching. I drove away the ice trolls who had claimed this mountain."

**About the Stolen Egg**:
• "As my eggs neared hatching, the ice trolls returned. They attacked me and stole one egg. I chased them for hours, but they fled into a narrow tunnel in another mountain. I could not fit inside to follow."
• "I do not know where the tunnel leads, but my child is still out there. Alive—I can feel it—but in danger."

**About What Happened to Baby**:
• "My first wyrmling hatched while I was chasing the thieves. Finding itself alone, it wandered from the lair. It must have been terrified."
• "You found it and brought it home safely. For this, I owe you a debt I can never fully repay."

**About "Nytha"** (if party asks):
• "Ah, you heard its first word! 'Nytha' means 'Mama' in Draconic, the language of dragons."
• "This wyrmling will always remember you as those who brought it home to Mama."

**About Silver Dragons** (if asked):
• "We silver dragons value courage, honor, and the protection of innocents. You have demonstrated all three."
• "In peaceful times, I enjoy sharing stories with people. You may visit any time."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**MORE WYRMLINGS HATCH!**

While party speaks with Rorn:

*"A sharp CRACK echoes through the chamber. You turn to see one of the intact eggs shuddering. A crack spreads across its silver surface, and a tiny claw punches through. Moments later, a second wyrmling breaks free, shaking off shell fragments and looking around with curious eyes. The same happens with the other egg—two more baby dragons emerge into the world.*

*Rorn watches with obvious joy and pride as her newly hatched children crawl to her. She pulls frozen meat from the nest and feeds them, making soft cooing sounds. The first wyrmling—the one you rescued—joins its siblings, nuzzling against its mother."*

**ROLEPLAY MOMENT**:
• Party witnesses dragon family reunited
• Emotional payoff for their hard work
• Three healthy wyrmlings safe because of party's actions
• One still missing (future quest hook)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**THE REWARD**:

After eggs hatch and wyrmlings are fed, Rorn addresses party:

*"You have already bonded with my first hatchling," Rorn says, gesturing to the wyrmling you rescued. "It deserves to continue learning what it means to grow up among your kind. Would you be willing to take it back to your settlement and raise it? I will watch over your area and aid you when I can, and I am always here if you have questions."*

*She digs into the snow where the eggs rested and pulls out several small objects—diamonds, each the size of your thumb, glittering in the dim light. "Please, take these as a sign of my gratitude."*

*The dragon continues: "I have another request. When I discover where the ice trolls have taken my fourth egg, would you retrieve it? My child must be saved from whatever the trolls have planned."*

**MATERIAL REWARD**:
• **Small diamond for each party member**
• **Value**: 50 gp each
• Can be sold or used as spell components
• Represents significant wealth for level 1-3 party

**QUEST REWARDS**:
• **Raise first wyrmling in settlement**: Dragon grows up learning about people, becomes ally
• **Rorn watches over area**: Protects Pinebrook region from threats
• **Future quest**: Retrieve stolen fourth egg from ice trolls (plot hook for future adventure)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PARTY'S RESPONSE**:

Let players react to Rorn's offer:
• Will they raise the wyrmling?
• Will they agree to retrieve stolen egg later?
• Do they have questions for Rorn?

**RORN'S FLEXIBILITY**:
• If party says no to raising wyrmling: "I understand. You have already done so much." (Not offended, but disappointed)
• If party says no to egg quest: "I will find another way. But know the offer stands if you change your mind."
• If party says yes: "You honor my family. I will not forget this kindness."

**RORN IS KIND**:
As long as party is polite and respectful, Rorn is friendly and grateful. She won't pressure them, won't be angry if they decline. She WILL remember if they agree and follow through.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RETURN TO PINEBROOK**:

After conversation concludes:

*"I will show you a faster way out," Rorn says. She leads you through a hidden passage—a tunnel you never would have found on your own. It winds through the mountain and emerges on a sunny hillside overlooking the forest. The village of Pinebrook is visible in the distance.*

*"Go with my blessing," the dragon says. "And remember: You have a friend in the mountains."*

*With a powerful leap, Rorn takes to the sky, her silver scales flashing in the sunlight as she returns to her lair and her wyrmlings.*

**ADVENTURE ENDS**:
• Party exits lair safely via secret tunnel
• Can see Pinebrook from mountainside
• Short journey back to village
• Baby dragon (if taken) chirps contentedly
• Quest complete!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DM TIPS - IF PARTY ATTACKS RORN**:

Dragons are INCREDIBLY powerful. Adult silver dragon is CR 15. Party is level 1-3. This would be instant TPK if played straight.

**HANDLE ATTACKS MULTIPLE WAYS**:

**Option 1 - Dragon Ignores Attacks**:
*"Your [weapon/spell] strikes the dragon's scales and bounces off harmlessly. She looks at you with disappointment, not anger. 'Don't be foolish.'"*

**Option 2 - Knowledge Check Warning**:
Before anyone attacks, call for DC 10 Nature check:
• Success: "You know a dragon this size could kill your entire party in seconds. Attacking would be suicide."
• Gives players out before committing

**Option 3 - Non-Lethal Breath Weapon**:
If party INSISTS on attacking:
*"Rorn sighs with disappointment and exhales. Freezing mist envelops you. You feel your body lock up—you can't move, but you're unharmed. 'You will stay frozen until you calm down,' she says. 'I do not wish to hurt you, but I will not tolerate attacks in my home.'"*
• Paralyzing breath (non-lethal version)
• Lasts 1 hour or until Rorn releases them
• If they calm down and apologize, she releases them early
• If they continue hostility, she carries them outside mountain and leaves them (no reward, no alliance)

**Option 4 - Immediate Consequences**:
*"The dragon's claw flashes out faster than you can see. You're pinned to the ground, her massive talon resting on your chest. 'One move and I crush you,' she growls. 'Now EXPLAIN why you attack someone who could incinerate you with a breath.'"*
• Non-lethal restraint
• Forces conversation
• Makes power dynamic VERY clear

**IMPORTANT**: Rorn doesn't WANT to hurt party. She's good-aligned. But she won't tolerate attacks. Use minimum force to stop hostility, then demand explanation. If party apologizes, she forgives them (though may not offer rewards).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CONVERSATION PROMPTS** (if players hesitate to roleplay):

• "The dragon asked you a direct question. What do you say?"
• "How does your character feel right now? Scared? Brave? Hopeful?"
• "What physical action does your character take? Do you bow? Step forward? Present the baby dragon?"
• "The dragon is waiting for your answer. The silence stretches..."

**ENCOURAGE ROLEPLAYING**:
This is pivotal story moment. Encourage players to speak IN CHARACTER:
• "What does [Character Name] say?"
• "How does [Character Name] explain what happened?"
• Let players take turns speaking if they want

**BABY DRAGON'S ROLE**:
If players struggling to convince Rorn:
• Baby dragon chirps insistently at mother
• Rorn pauses, listens to baby
• "My child tells me you fed it, protected it, carried it home safely. Is this true?"
• Baby dragon provides corroboration

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 10-15 minutes

**EMOTIONAL BEATS**:
1. **Terror**: Massive dragon appears, angry and dangerous
2. **Tension**: Party must explain selves without provoking attack
3. **Relief**: Dragon realizes they're allies, not enemies
4. **Joy**: Eggs hatch, family reunited
5. **Gratitude**: Dragon thanks them and offers rewards
6. **Hope**: Future alliance forged, more adventures ahead

**AFTERMATH**:
• Party returns to Pinebrook as heroes
• Dragon ally gained (major resource)
• Plot hook for future adventure (stolen egg)
• Wyrmling companion (if accepted)
• Diamonds (material reward)
• XP for completing adventure

This is CLIMAX of Peril in Pinebrook. Make it memorable!]]></text>

<name>Conclusion DM Notes</name>
<text><![CDATA[**EXPECTED PLAYTIME**: 10-15 minutes

**USE STATS ONLY IF**:
• Party somehow forces combat (bad idea)
• Need to reference for description
• Players ask specific questions about power

**DON'T MAKE THIS COMBAT**: This is roleplaying encounter. Combat would be unsatisfying (party dies) or anticlimactic (DM pulls punches obviously).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**RORN'S EMOTIONAL JOURNEY**:

**Initial State**: Angry, suspicious, protective
• Just returned from failed chase of egg thieves
• Finds strangers in lair near eggs

• Typical party of 4 = 200 gp total value
• Significant wealth for level 1-3 characters
• Can sell or use as spell components (Revivify, Chromatic Orb, etc.)

• **Access to dragon lore**: Can visit Rorn for advice, knowledge
• **Future quests**: Egg retrieval mission creates ongoing story
• **Reputation boost**: "We're friends with a dragon" = major social leverage

**Wyrmling Companion** (if accepted):

• Dragon learns about people, becomes ally
• Long-term relationship (silver dragons live 1,000+ years)
• Wyrmling grows slowly (years to reach adulthood)

• Creates emotional attachment (party raised it from hatchling)

**Intangible Rewards**:
• Satisfaction of successful quest
• Heroic story to tell
• Good deed done (saved dragon family)
• Moral high ground (helped innocent creatures)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FUTURE PLOT HOOKS**:

**Stolen Egg Quest**:
• Fourth egg taken by ice trolls
• Still alive (Rorn can sense it)
• Hidden in troll lair somewhere
• Rorn will eventually locate it
• Sends party to retrieve when ready
• Future adventure: Assault on ice troll lair

**Raising Wyrmling**:
• Baby dragon grows in settlement
• Creates ongoing story opportunities
• Wyrmling gets into trouble (curious, energetic)
• Villagers react (some love it, some fear it)
• Teaching dragon about people/society
• Dragon becomes attached to party

**Rorn's Alliance**:
• Dragon watches over region
• May intervene if major threat appears
• Party can visit for advice
• Rorn may call on party for future help
• Builds long-term campaign relationship

**Trolls Remain Threat**:
• Ice trolls still out there
• Now they know about party (party killed egg snatchers)
• May seek revenge
• Egg snatchers were servants—full troll tribe exists
• Future conflict inevitable

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**HANDLING DIFFERENT PARTY RESPONSES**:

**Party Accepts All Offers** (raise wyrmling, retrieve egg):
• Rorn is delighted and grateful
• "You honor my family. When the time comes, I will call upon you."
• Strongest alliance path
• Maximum future story potential

**Party Accepts Wyrmling, Declines Egg Quest**:
• Rorn understands: "The trolls are dangerous. I will find another way."
• Still forges alliance (party raising wyrmling)
• Egg quest remains open (can change mind later)

**Party Declines Wyrmling, Accepts Egg Quest**:
• Rorn respects decision: "Raising a wyrmling is a great responsibility."
• Egg quest locked in for future
• Wyrmling stays with mother

**Party Declines Both**:
• Rorn is disappointed but understanding
• "You have already done much. I will not ask more."
• Still gives diamonds (they earned them)
• Alliance weaker but still exists (Rorn remembers what they did)
• Doors remain open if party changes mind

**NO WRONG ANSWER**: Any choice is valid. Rorn won't be angry. She's grateful regardless.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DRACONIC LANGUAGE MOMENTS**:

**"Nytha" Callback**:
Baby dragon says "Nytha" when seeing mother—first word comes full circle.
• Mama = Nytha
• Emotional payoff for earlier translation puzzle
• Shows dragon language matters

**Other Draconic Words**:
Rorn occasionally uses Draconic terms naturally:
• "Wyrmling" (baby dragon)
• "Orn darastrix" (silver dragon—mirror puzzle answer)
• Names (Hysvearorn)

Reinforces: This is dragon culture, dragon language matters in this world.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**SECRET PASSAGE EXIT**:

Rorn shows party hidden exit because:
• Faster than retracing steps
• Avoids dangerous slides/mirrors
• Mother dragon knows lair perfectly
• Reward for completing quest (skip backtracking)

**Passage Description**:
• Tunnel party never would've found
• Smooth walls (dragon-carved)
• Emerges on sunny hillside
• Pinebrook visible below
• Scenic and peaceful after dangerous lair

**Narrative Purpose**:
• Avoids boring "walk back through same areas"
• Creates sense of dragon's power (she knows secret ways)
• Beautiful ending image (emerging into sunlight)
• Clear transition from adventure back to safety

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**FINAL MOMENTS**:

**Rorn's Farewell**:
*"Go with my blessing. Remember: You have a friend in the mountains."*

**Dragon Takes Flight**:
Describe her launching skyward—massive wings, powerful grace, silver scales catching sunlight. Awe-inspiring and beautiful.

**Party's Journey Home**:
Short walk from mountainside back to Pinebrook. Time to decompress, discuss events, celebrate victory.

**Arrival in Pinebrook**:
Captain Kole relieved and grateful. Villagers celebrate heroes. Wyrmling (if with party) becomes instant celebrity.

**ADVENTURE COMPLETE**: Peril in Pinebrook resolved!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**IMPORTANT - DO NOT USE IN COMBAT**:

These stats are for REFERENCE ONLY. Party is level 1-3. CR 15 dragon would kill them instantly. This encounter is ROLEPLAY, not combat.

**Use stats only for**:
• Describing her power and presence
• Answering player questions ("How big is she?" "Could we take her?")
• Reinforcing that attacking would be suicide

**If party forces combat**: Use non-lethal options (paralyzing breath, restraint, dismissal). Don't kill party—just make consequences clear.]]></text>
